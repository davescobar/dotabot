Stats & Effects:**\n-   The item provides a 5-point bonus to all stats.\n-   In ghost form, the wielder is 40% more vulnerable to magic damage.\n-   The ability has a duration of 4 seconds and a cooldown of 22 seconds.\n\n**4.  Usage Notes:**\n-   The ability ends if the wielder becomes Spell Immune.\n-   It has no effect if the wielder is already Spell Immune.\n-   The ability shares cooldown with Ethereal Blade.\n-   The ability is an instant-cast ability with a directional cast range.\n\n**5.

Overview:**\nThe Aetherial Hammer is an active item that channels a spell, dealing impact damage to enemies within a 400 radius area, stunning them for 0.5 seconds, and applying a burn effect that deals damage over time and slows non-building units for 20% for 6 seconds. The item also has a passive effect, increasing the targeted spell and item Area of Effect by 20%.\n\n**2. Components:**\nNone\n\n**3. Stats & Effects:**\n* **Active Effects:**\n\t+ Deals impact damage to enemies within a 400 radius area: 150 for units and 95 for buildings\n\t+ Applies a burn effect dealing damage over time to enemies: 60 for buildings and 60 for units\n\t+ Slows non-building units for 20% for 6 seconds\n\t+ Stuns enemies for 0.5 seconds\n* **Passive Effect:**\n\t+ Increases targeted spell and item Area of Effect by 20%\n* **Item Stats:**\n\t+ Item Cost: 5900 gold\n\t+ Cooldown: 24 seconds\n\t+ Mana Cost: 100\n\t+ Ability Channel Time: 1.5 seconds\n\t+ Ability Cast Range: 600\n\t+ Ability Mana Cost: 100\n\t+ Ability Cooldown: 24 seconds\n\n**4. Usage Notes:**\nThe Aetherial Hammer is a ground-targeted ability with an area effect. It has a channel time of 1.5 seconds and a cooldown of 24 seconds. The burn effect and slow are applied to non-building units, while the damage over time is applied to both buildings and units.\n\n**5. Strategic Value:**\nThe Aetherial Hammer is typically purchased in the late game due to its high item cost. It is usually used to deal area damage and control enemy movements with its burn and slow effects. Its ability to increase the targeted spell and item Area of Effect makes it a valuable item for players who rely on spells and items with area effects.",

The Berserk ability can be used to quickly close the distance and deal physical damage, but the reduced armor and silence can make the wearer vulnerable to counter-attacks. The Lifesteal passive can help the wearer sustain themselves in prolonged fights.\n\n**Strategic Value:**\nThe Mask of Madness is typically purchased in the late game, around 50-60 minutes into the match. It is usually purchased by aggressive heroes who want to increase their attack speed and movement speed, but can also be used by more defensive heroes to initiate fights and catch enemies off guard. Its role is that of a high-damage, high-mobility item that can be used to turn the tide of a team fight.",

Its primary function is to offer healing and protection to nearby allies through its active ability, Mend, and a passive aura that grants health regeneration, mana regeneration, and armor.\n\n**2.  Components:**\nThe Guardian Greaves is built from the following items: Arcane Boots, Buckler, and Mekansm.\n\n**3.  Stats & Effects:**\n-   **Mend (Active):** Restores 325 health and 200 mana to nearby allies within a 1200 radius, removing most negative effects from the caster. The cooldown for this ability is 45 seconds.\n-   **Guardian Aura (Passive):** Grants 2.5 health regeneration, 1.5 mana regeneration, and 3 armor to allied units within a 1200 radius.

The Mechanical Arm likely enhances the player's abilities in some way, but the exact effects are not specified in the provided metadata.\n\n**2. Components:**\nNone\n\n**3. Stats & Effects:**\nThe Mechanical Arm has the following stats and effects:\n\n* Bat attribute: +0.1 (though the description of this attribute is unclear, it may imply an increased attack speed or damage)\n* Stun chance: 10% (there is a 10% chance to stun enemies)\n* Stun duration: 0.1 seconds (enemies are stunned for 0.1 seconds when hit by the Mechanical Arm)\n\n**4. Usage Notes:**\nThe Mechanical Arm is a passive item, meaning it does not have an active ability. It is likely used to enhance the player's attacks or movement speed, but the exact mechanics are unclear.

    "text": "**1. Overview:**\nThe Harpoon is a regular item that enhances the user's melee capabilities. It has a passive effect called Echo Strike, which causes melee attacks to attack twice in quick succession, applying a movement slow to the target. The Harpoon also has an active ability called Draw Forth, which fires a harpoon at an enemy, pulling the caster and the target closer together.\n\n**2. Components:**\nThe Harpoon is built from two components: Diadem and Echo Sabre.\n\n**3. Stats & Effects:**\nThe Harpoon provides the following stats and effects:\n- **Passive Effects:** Echo Strike causes melee attacks to attack twice in quick succession, applying a 100% movement slow for 1 second on the first strike. The cooldown for Echo Strike is 5 seconds.\n- **Active Ability:** Draw Forth fires a harpoon at an enemy, pulling the caster and the target closer together up to 35% of the distance between them. If the caster is melee, they are always pulled to within melee distance of the target. The cooldown for Draw Forth is 19 seconds, and the mana cost is 50.\n- **Stats:** The Harpoon provides a bonus damage of 25, a bonus strength of 25, a bonus agility of 10, a bonus intellect of 10, and a bonus mana regen of 2.\n\n**4. Usage Notes:**\nThe Harpoon's Draw Forth ability can be used to initiate or reposition in team fights. The Echo Strike passive can be used to slow down enemies and make them more vulnerable to attacks. The Harpoon's stats can enhance the user's damage output and survivability.\n\n**5. Strategic Value:**\nThe Harpoon is usually purchased in the late game due to its high cost. It is a versatile item that can be used by melee heroes to enhance their damage output and repositioning capabilities.",

Its primary role is to provide additional survivability and allow the hero to stay in combat longer, making it a valuable asset in the early stages of the game.",
