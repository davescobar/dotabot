[[File:Focus Fire icon.png|frame]]
&lt;dfn&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/dfn&gt; is the frequency with which units attack is measured. A unit's attack speed can be modified by [[items]], per point of {{Attribute ID|agility}}, abilities providing flat bonuses and [[aura]]s.

==Mechanics==
[[File:IAS vs BAT Attack per second graph.png|thumb|{{tooltip|IAS|Increased attack speed}} vs {{tooltip|BAT|Base attack time}}: attacks per second]]
Most heroes have a base attack speed and base attack time of {{G|attack speed}} and {{G|base attack time}} respectively.

Total attack speed is defined as 

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Σ Attack Speed = (Base Attack Speed + Σ [[File:Agility attribute symbol.png|24px|Agility|link=Agility]] Current + [[Attack speed#Modifying Attack Speed|Σ Flat Attack Speed Bonuses]]) × (1 + Attack Speed Multiplier), &amp; {{G|attack speed min}} ≤ Σ Attack Speed ≤ {{G|attack speed max}}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;section begin=as intro /&gt;Attack speed bonuses and reductions stack additively by a flat value and/or percentages. By default, the total attack speed value has a minimum of {{G|attack speed min}} and an maximum value of {{G|attack speed max}} and most unit's attack speeds cannot be reduced or increased beyond the values above.&lt;section end=as intro /&gt;

{{Anchor|Attack Rate}}
The attack rate is the amount of attacks a unit can launch within a second, and is defined as 

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;r = (Σ Attack Speed) / (100 × [[Attack speed#Base Attack Time|BAT]])

Therefore, the time needed per attack a hero launches is defined as

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;T = 1 / r&lt;/span&gt;

==Base Attack Time==
Every unit has a base attack time (&lt;dfn&gt;BAT&lt;/dfn&gt;), which refers to the default interval between attacks for a unit without considering {{Attribute ID|agility}} and attack speed bonus. 

For example, a {{U|Melee Creep}} has a BAT of {{Show|U|Melee Creep|base attack time}}, and thus attacks once per second by default. Similarly, if a hero with {{G|base attack time}} BAT with no {{Attribute ID|agility}} and no bonus attack speed, they would attack once every 1.7 seconds. While nearly every unit can have their attack speed modified, only a few heroes can actively change their BAT.

===Examples===
: With a base attack time of {{Show|H|Marci|base attack time}}, {{Show|H|Marci|attack speed}} base attack speed and {{Show|H|Marci|agility}} {{Attribute ID|agility}} at level 1. What is {{H|Marci}}'s current attack rate?

: AttackRate = ({{Show|H|Marci|attack speed}} + {{Show|H|Marci|agility}}) / ({{Show|H|Marci|attack speed}} x {{Show|H|Marci|base attack time}}) = {{#vardefineecho:eg1 f|{{#expr:({{Show|H|Marci|attack speed}}+{{Show|H|Marci|agility}})/({{Show|H|Marci|attack speed}}*{{Show|H|Marci|base attack time}}) round3}}}}

: Attack s^-1 = 1/r = {{#vardefineecho:eg1 t|{{#expr:1/{{#var:eg1 f}} round3}}}}

: {{H|Marci}} attacks about {{#var:eg1 f}} times per second in this example, and takes {{#var:eg1 t}} seconds between attacks.

===Benchmark===
Most heroes' attack rate is {{#expr:1/{{G|base attack time}} round3}} attacks per second. Attack speed is expressed in percent of base attack speed. The base is therefore expressed as {{G|attack speed}}. Each point of increased attack speed (IAS) sources add {{#expr:{{G|attack speed}}/100}} point to it, and attack speed works together with base attack time to determine how often a unit can attack.

When hovering over the hero's attributes in the [[HUD]], the first field shows the attack speed and the time required per attack in parenthesis. The attack speed field is defaulted to {{G|attack speed}} and adds the attack speed bonuses or reductions afterwards, leading to a minimum of {{G|attack speed min}} and a maximum value of {{g|attack speed max}}.

Even though the HUD may show a unit to exceed these boundaries, the actual attack speed used for calculations will still obey the minimum and maximum values.

For units that do not have {{G|base attack time}} BAT, the attack speed values in the [[HUD]] will be displayed as if they have {{G|base attack time}} BAT. For example, a unit with {{#vardefineecho:bateg|0.85}} BAT and no other attack speed bonus sources will display itself as having an attack speed of {{#expr:{{#var:bateg}}*{{G|base attack time}}}}, because {{#var:bateg}} seconds is how long a unit with {{G|base attack time}} BAT and {{#expr:{{#var:bateg}}*{{G|base attack time}}}} attack speed would take in between attacks. 

This strange quirk makes it harder to figure out if a hero without the standard {{G|base attack time}} BAT is nearing maximum attack speed, but it does allow players to compare this uniform metric across all heroes easier. 

The following table shows the attack speed benchmarks and their effect on attacks per second:

==Base Attack Speed==
{{Grouped attribute table|hero|atkspeed|value heading=Attack Speed}}

==Attack Speed Limits==
Heroes with a unique base attack speed will also have a unique minimum attack speed equal to the difference between the hero's base attack speed and the default {{G|attack speed}} base attack speed. 

For example, {{H|Tiny}} has a base attack speed of {{Show|H|Tiny|attack speed}}, which is {{#vardefineecho:Tiny attack speed difference|{{#expr:{{G|attack speed}}-{{Show|H|Tiny|attack speed}}}}}} less attack speed than the default {{G|attack speed}}. Therefore, his minimum attack speed will be {{#vardefineecho:Tiny attack speed min|{{#expr:{{G|attack speed min}}-{{#var:Tiny attack speed difference}}}}}}, which is {{#var:Tiny attack speed difference}} less attack speed than the default {{G|attack speed min}} minimum attack speed.

This means despite {{H|Tiny}} and {{H|Drow Ranger}} both having the same {{G|base attack time}} [[Attack speed#Base Attack Time|BAT]], their slowest attack rates are {{#invoke:loop|a|0|2|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:1/({{#ifexpr:{{#var:a}}=0|{{#var:Tiny attack speed min}}|{{G|attack speed min}}}}/{{G|base attack time}}/100) round2}} {{#ifexpr:{{#var:a}}=0|and&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} seconds respectively.  This works in reverse for higher base attack speeds — {{H|Mirana}}, whose base attack speed is {{Show|H|Mirana|attack speed}}, will have a minimum attack speed of {{#vardefine:Mirana attack speed difference|{{#expr:{{G|attack speed}}-{{Show|H|Mirana|attack speed}}}}}}{{#vardefineecho:Mirana attack speed min|{{#expr:{{G|attack speed min}}-{{#var:Mirana attack speed difference}}}}}}.  

However, this minimum attack speed mechanic does not appear to apply to non-hero units. For example, {{U|Roshan}} and {{H|Hoodwink}}, who both have {{Show|H|Hoodwink|base attack time}} BAT, both have a minimum attack rate of {{#expr:1/({{G|attack speed min}}/{{Show|U|Roshan|base attack time}}/100) round2}} seconds, despite Roshan having a base attack speed of {{Show|U|Roshan|attack speed}}.

The maximum attack speed of all heroes is {{G|attack speed max}}. This value does not change based on the heroes' base attack speed. This means that heroes like {{H|Tiny}} have a greater attack speed range ({{#var:Tiny attack speed min}} – {{G|attack speed max}}) , and heroes like {{H|Mirana}} have a lesser attack speed range ({{#var:Mirana attack speed min}} – {{G|attack speed max}}) than the average hero ({{G|attack speed min}} – {{G|attack speed max}}).

&lt;!--=== Minimum Attack Speed ===--&gt;
===Maximum Attack Speed===
The following abilities are able to change a unit's maximum attack speed (of {{G|attack speed max}}), allowing it to reach even higher values. If a unit is affected by multiple abilities that change the maximum value, the higher value takes priority.

===Items===
Many items grant their owners an attack speed bonus, increasing their attack speed when equipped, either by increasing their agility, or by just giving them a flat bonus.

The following items increase a unit's attack speed. The effects are limited to the item's owner, which must have the item equipped.

Items that provide attack speed bonus by flat amount and agility:
{{#lpdb:datapoint
| conditions = [[type::item_bonustraits]] AND [[extradata_bonus_attack_speed::!]] AND [[extradata_bonus_agility::!]] AND [[extradata_game::]]

| template = Item bonus value table el{{!}}attack_speed{{!}}agility{{!}}modifier2={{G|bonus attack speed}}
| endtemplate = Item bonus value table end
| default = No items found!
| order = name ASC
}}

These items have a flat attack speed bonus to the hero who has them equipped.

[[File:Alchemist Greevil's Greed abilityicon dota2 gameasset.png|frame]]
{{Quotation|Alchemist|Now that's how you make gold.|sound=vo_alchemist_alch_lasthit_02.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Gold&lt;/dfn&gt; is the currency used to buy items or instantly revive your hero. Gold can be earned from killing [[heroes]], [[creeps]], or [[buildings]].

==Reliable &amp; Unreliable Gold==
A player's gold is split into '''reliable gold''' and '''unreliable gold'''. 
* '''Reliable gold'''  : Passive gold receive every seconds; Gold gained from activating bounty runes.
* '''Unreliable gold''' : Any other source (Hero kills, Creep kills, Building destroys, Hand of Midas, Track, etc).

The difference between the two is how each one is spent:
* Dying only takes away gold from the unreliable gold pool.
* Buying items uses up the unreliable gold first before falling back to reliable gold.
* Buyback uses reliable gold first.

Hovering the mouse cursor over the gold display in the [[HUD]] shows brings up a tooltip showing reliable and unreliable gold totals.

==Net Worth==
A hero's net worth is the sum of their gold and the cost of all the items they own, no matter where they are on the map. An item that has been consumed or destroyed doesn't count towards net worth, since it doesn't exist anymore. While it's usually used as an indicator of the player's performance, gameplay-wise it affects unfavorably the cost of buyback, and the amount of gold gained by hero kills on both sides.

Some items however aren't factored in certain conditions:
* Items in the inventory of a unit of the enemy team. 
* The following items on the ground:
** {{I|Gem of True Sight}}
** {{I|Divine Rapier}}. Note that as soon as an enemy of the owner picks it up for the first time, the item will be owned by the one who has it in their inventory.
* The items obtained by randomizing the hero pick, found by the {{I|Trusty Shovel}}, or {{I|Town Portal Scroll|text=Town Portal Scrolls}} obtained by dying or from the {{I|Boots of Travel}}.
** If any of these is part of a stack of items, they are always consumed first.

Some [[consumables]] grant a buff that increases the target's net worth by the cost of the item when used, in order to not decrease the team's net worth:
* {{I|Moon Shard}}
* {{I|Aghanim's Blessing}}, {{I|Aghanim's Blessing - Roshan}} and {{A|Alchemist|Aghanim's Scepter Synth}}
* {{I|Aghanim's Shard}} and {{I|Aghanim's Shard - Consumable}}

==Acquiring gold==
===Starting gold===
Every hero starts with {{Gold|{{G|starting gold}}}} gold and 1 {{I|Town Portal Scroll}} at the beginning of the game. If the player randoms, they are given a {{I|Faerie Fire}} and an {{I|Enchanted Mango}} as well. None of these free items can be sold.

===Periodic Gold===
Each player passively receives {{Gold|1}} reliable gold every {{#expr:60/{{G|base gpm}} round2}} seconds (starting from 0:00 on the game clock), which results in {{Gold|{{G|base gpm}}}} gold every minute, at the start of the game. This periodic gold increases over time based on the in-game clock.

===Hero kills===
Hero kills grant unreliable gold to the killer. The first hero that is killed in a match gives a bonus {{Gold|{{G|first blood gold}}}} unreliable gold to the killer; this is called &lt;ab&gt;vo announcer killing spree announcer 1stblood 01.mp3&lt;/ab&gt; &lt;font color ='#8A0707'&gt;'''First Blood!'''&lt;/font&gt;. Bonus gold is also awarded for stopping kill streaks.

When a hero dies to enemy creeps or an enemy tower and has not been damaged by any enemy heroes in the last {{G|kill time window}} seconds (regardless of distance between heroes), the kill gold is split among all enemy heroes. When a hero dies to enemy creeps or an enemy tower and has been damaged by only one enemy, that enemy is credited with the kill. When a hero dies to enemy creeps or an enemy tower and has been damaged by two or more enemies, the gold is split equally amongst all heroes that assisted. Damage negation to 0 credits as assist too.

Every time a hero kills an enemy hero, the killer is awarded unreliable gold using the following formula:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
! class="header" width="225px" | Hero Kills Base Gold
! class="header" width="225px" | First Blood Gold
|-
| {{Gold|{{G|kill base gold}}}}
| {{Gold|{{G|first blood gold}}}}
|}

: &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Σ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;i&gt;Bounty&lt;sub&gt;Gold&lt;/sub&gt; = b&lt;sub&gt;Gold&lt;/sub&gt; + (DeadHero&lt;sub&gt;LVL&lt;/sub&gt; × {{G|kill lvl multiplier}}) + Streak&lt;sub&gt;Gold&lt;/sub&gt; + FB&lt;/i&gt;

===Kill Streaks===
As a hero accrues multiple kills without dying that player is said to be on a '''Kill Streak'''. An additional gold bounty is granted to the player that ends another player's kill streak; this is sometimes called Shutdown Gold. Kill streaks start at {{G|kill streak min}} kills and increase for each kill up to {{G|kill streak max}} kills, but do not increase beyond {{G|kill streak max}} kills.

The streak bounty is defined by the following formula:

: {{#tag:math|f(x) = ({{G|kill streak gold value}}k^{{G|kill streak gold exponent}} + {{G|kill streak gold value}}x)}}

* Deaths where the killing blow is dealt by [[neutral creeps]], including {{U|Roshan}} and [[Tormentor]]s.
* Deaths where the killing blow is dealt by [[Denies|the dying hero's team.]]
* Deaths where the killing blow is dealt by an enemy [[tower]] or [[lane creep]], if no enemy heroes damaged them in the last {{G|kill time window}} seconds.
* Deaths which trigger [[Reincarnation]].

===Assists (AoE gold)===
Allied heroes within {{G|assist radius}} radius of a killed enemy, including the killer, receive experience and unreliable gold if they assisted in the kill. To qualify for an assist, the allied hero either has to be within the given radius of the dying enemy hero, or have damaged or debuffed the enemy hero. Note that the assist counter on the scoreboard only counts assists if the player dealt damage or applied a debuff to the victim, or if they applied a buff to the killer, but gold and experience are awarded independently of the "assist" counter.

The amount of assist gold received is the same for the killer and all assisting heroes. It is calculated using the following formula:


&lt;code&gt;({{G|assist base gold}} + Victim Net Worth x {{G|assist networth factor}}) x k  / Number of Heroes&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;k = Net Worth difference factor&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;For leading team k = 1 - (Net Worth difference / Net Worth of leading team)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;For losing team k = 1 + (Net Worth difference / Net Worth of leading team)&lt;/code&gt;

===Buildings===
{{main|Buildings}}
When an enemy [[tower]] is destroyed, unreliable gold is awarded to each player on your team. The player that got the last hit on the building is credited with destroying it and receives some bonus unreliable gold. If a tower gets [[denied]], both teams get {{#expr:{{G|tower deny factor}}*100}}% of its team gold bounty. If no player gets the last hit and the tower instead dies to lane creeps, no player gets the extra bonus gold.

==Spending and losing gold==
===Drafting phase===
During the drafting phase in [[All Pick]] and [[Ranked All Pick]], the player loses {{Gold|{{G|draft gold loss}}}} gold per second if they have not picked a hero after the selection timer runs out.

===Items===
The main purpose of gold is to purchase [[items]]. The player with the most gold is able to buy the most powerful items, and therefore has a very strong hero. The items each player buys depend on their role in the team and many other factors.

TODO: Send people to another page with all items.

* {{I|Divine Rapier}} and {{I|Gem of True Sight}} cannot be sold.
* {{I|Cheese}} cannot be purchased, but can be sold for {{Show|I|Cheese|sell value}} gold.
* {{I|Refresher Shard}} cannot be purchased, but can be sold for {{Show|I|Refresher Shard|sell value}} gold.

===Death===
&lt;section begin=lossexpr /&gt;A hero loses the following amount of [[unreliable gold]] every time it dies. Dying does not take away reliable gold.
* {{cf|expr}} &lt;code&gt;GoldLoss = NetWorth/{{G|death gold loss divisor}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;section end=lossexpr /&gt;

}}&lt;section end=Buyback /&gt;

Due to the high cooldown, high gold cost, and heavy penalties, using buyback should be a thoroughly thought-through action, as it can backfire and cause more harm than good. Scenarios, where a buyback may be a good idea, are when a crucial team fight starts while one is dead, in order to join the fight. Another crucial moment is when the base needs defending, or when having died during a team fight which your team still won and is going for a final push. Buyback should generally not be used to skip death timing to farm, as the gold cost is usually too big to make it ever worth it. Also, the death time penalty gets added on the next death. Especially on high levels, an early or ill-fated buyback can easily lead to a very long respawn time on the next death.

===Abandoning the game===
After being disconnected from the game for more than 5 minutes, all of the player's gold is equally distributed between the remaining players on their team. This distribution continues every second, so that any gold they gain afterwards gets distributed as well. This distributing stops when the player reconnects, but the gold that got distributed is not reimbursed.

[[File:Kraken Shell icon.png|frame]]
&lt;dfn&gt;Damage Block&lt;/dfn&gt; is a mechanic that reduces incoming damage, typically by a flat amount.


==Overview==
Damage block differs from [[Damage Manipulation]] in that it always reduces instead of increasing incoming damage, and is able to block damage with the [[HP Removal]] flag.

There exist four different categories of damage block currently, which are listed by the order of proccing below.

==Mana Shield Damage Block==
Driven by {{code|MODIFIER_PROPERTY_TOTAL_CONSTANT_BLOCK_UNAVOIDABLE_PRE_ARMOR}}.

{{A|Medusa|Mana Shield}} blocks damage of all types, before all other damage manipulation. The block value is variable and adapts to the damage value of the incoming instance.

==Physical Damage Block==
&lt;section begin=main /&gt;[[File:Damage Block.png|thumb|200px|{{H|Axe}} blocking physical attack damage with {{I|Vanguard}}.&lt;br&gt;The ochre number displays the total amount of damage blocked.]]

Driven by {{code|MODIFIER_PROPERTY_PHYSICAL_CONSTANT_BLOCK}}.

Physical damage block reduces any [[physical]] damage a unit takes from attacks or from [[cleave]], with the exception of damage dealt by attacks from [[ward]]-type units. Physical damage block offers no protection against spells, with only a few [[Damage block#Blocked Spell Damage|exceptions]].

Physical damage block triggers after {{A|Medusa|Mana Shield}}, but before all other damage manipulation. This means that the higher the unit's armor is, the less actual reduction is provided by damage block. However, the effectiveness of damage block is only meaningful in relation to the attacker's damage. See [[Attack damage#Total Attack Damage|total attack damage]] for detailed examples with calculation.

When physical damage block procs, an ocher-colored negative number pops up on the unit, with a shield icon on the right side of the &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;span style="color:#CC7722"&gt;-x&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; number. This number shows the exact amount of damage blocked.

Chanced-based physical damage block uses [[pseudo-random distribution]].&lt;section end=main /&gt;

Driven by {{code|MODIFIER_PROPERTY_MAGICAL_CONSTANT_BLOCK}}.

Magical damage block reduces any [[magical]] damage a unit takes from attacks or from spells.

Magical damage block triggers after {{A|Medusa|Mana Shield}}, but before all other damage manipulation. This means that the higher the unit's magic resistance is, the less actual reduction is provided by damage block.

When magical damage block procs, a cyan-colored number pops up on the unit, showing the exact amount of damage blocked.&lt;section end=magical /&gt;

==Universal Damage Block==
&lt;section begin=universal /&gt;Driven by {{code|MODIFIER_PROPERTY_TOTAL_CONSTANT_BLOCK}}.

Universal damage block reduces damage of all three types a unit takes. It triggers after almost every other source of damage manipulation. Therefore, [[on-damage effects|on-damage effect]] will proc directly afterwards.&lt;section end=universal /&gt;

}}
{{SkillListTail}}

==Stacking==
Within the same damage block category, if multiple sources of damage block activate, the actual blocked damage is taken from the source with the highest block value, and the other sources cannot reduce damage any further. Sources from different categories simply block the damage sequentially, independent of each other. Thus, it is inadvisable to stack multiple damage block sources of the same category.

====Side Effects====
Many sources of damage block have negative side effects that can take place when blocking damage. When multiple sources of the same category activate at once, even though only the source with the highest block value actually reduces damage, the side effects will all activate regardless.

For example, {{I|Infused Raindrops}} and {{I|Dandelion Amulet}} will both go on cooldown from one single magical damage instance, and a single attack can remove a stack from both {{A|Ogre Magi|Fire Shield}}, {{A|Visage|Gravekeeper's Cloak}}, while simultaneously causing  {{A|Kunkka|Ghostship}} rum hangover.

Thus, it could be inadvisable to try and stack multiple damage block sources of the same category.

===Chance-based blocking===
The proc chances of physical damage block work independently from each other. The probability of proccing any damage block when there are multiple damage block sources of the same value can be defined as

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;% Block = 1 - &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(1 - [[Damage block#Sources|Damage Block Sources]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; )&lt;/span&gt;

====Examples====
;Example 1&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:vg block chance percent|{{Show|A|Vanguard|Damage Block|value1}}}}&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:vg block chance|{{#expr:{{#explode:{{#var:vg block chance percent}}|%}}/100}}}}
: {{H|Huskar}} has two {{I|Vanguard|text=Vanguards}} in his inventory. What is the probability that one of them will proc when he is attacked?

:: Block Chance
:: = 1 - (1 - {{#var:vg block chance}}) × (1 - {{#var:vg block chance}})
:: = 1 - {{#expr:(1-{{#var:vg block chance}})^2}}
:: = {{#expr:1-(1-{{#var:vg block chance}})^2}}

: As {{I|Vanguard}} has a Damage Block proc chance of {{#var:vg block chance percent}}, the probability of Damage Block proccing when he is attacked is {{#expr:(1-(1-{{#var:vg block chance}})^2)*100}}%.

;Example 2&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:vg eg2|{{#expr:{{#explode:{{Show|A|Vanguard|Damage Block|value1}}|%}}/100*{{#explode:{{Show|A|Crimson Guard|Guard|value2}}|%}}/100*100}}}}
: {{H|Warlock}} is affected by {{A|Crimson Guard|Guard}} and he has one {{I|Vanguard}} in his inventory. What is the probability for each source of Damage Block to proc?

:: The Proc Chance and Damage Block for both sources are:
::* {{A|Crimson Guard|Guard}} from Crimson Guard: {{Show|A|Crimson Guard|Guard|value2}} chance, {{Show|A|Crimson Guard|Guard|value3}} damage blocked
::* {{I|Vanguard}}: {{Show|A|Vanguard|Damage Block|value1}} chance, {{Show|A|Vanguard|Damage Block|value3}} damage blocked on a ranged hero like {{H|Warlock}}

: As {{A|Crimson Guard|Guard}} procs on every hit, and its blocked damage value is greater than that of {{I|Vanguard}}, 
: {{I|Vanguard}} will have no effect on damage blocked whether it procs or not.

{{Quotation|Clockwerk|Armored to the teeth!|sound=vo_rattletrap_ratt_attack_10.mp3}}
{{Hatnote|For items within the Armor category, see [[Items#Armor|Items]].}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Armor&lt;/dfn&gt; is a stat that reduces (or increases, if negative) [[physical]] damage a unit takes from abilities and attacks. Every unit is capable of gaining or losing armor, and most units start with a small amount of base armor, some even starting with negative armor. A hero's armor can be passively increased with {{M|agility}} via leveling up, certain [[items]], {{M|talents}} and [[#Modifying Armor|some abilities]]. Armor of any unit can also be temporarily increased or reduced with some abilities.

Each point of {{M|agility}} increases a hero's armor by {{#expr:{{G|bonus armor}} round3}} or &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;{{#expr:ceil (1/{{G|bonus armor}})}}&lt;/sub&gt;.

The total armor is defined as

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;ΣArmor = [[#Main Armor|Main]] × f([[Armor#Armor Negating Sources|ArmorNegation]]) ± FlatBonus&lt;/span&gt;
__TOC__
==Definition==
The actual total armor according to the unit's {{Code|ent_text}} is up to two decimal places. The [[HUD]]'s displays the rounded down armor value next to the hero portrait, while the details tab displays the armor value rounded up.

==Main Armor==
{{See also|Table of hero attributes}}
'''Main Armor''' is the armor value shown in white numbers near the shield icon in the HUD, this is the sum of both the [[Armor#Base Armor|base armor]] and {{M|agility}}-based armor. The ways to improve a hero's main armor are leveling up, acquiring certain items, or with the help of certain abilities.

===Base Armor===
'''Base Armor''' is a fixed, predefined value for each unit individually of the main armor that never changes throughout a game. Since only heroes have utilizes {{M|agility}}, the [[HUD]] of all non-hero units shows only their base armor.

'''Bonus Armor''' is the {{Code|+Armor}} value shown in green numbers with a plus on the left, right after the white armor number.

Most manipulation sources affect the {{M|bonus armor|x}} of the affected unit, reduction sources can nevertheless bring total armor into negative values if the {{M|main armor}} value is sufficiently small.

{{M|Illusions}} do not benefit from {{M|bonus armor|x}} sources. Their [[HUD]] still displays the bonus armor granted for camouflaging purposes.

{{Quotation|Kunkka|No room to swing a cat in this crowd.|sound=vo_kunkka_kunk_attack_09.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Cleave&lt;/dfn&gt; causes a {{Symbol|Melee}} [[melee]] unit's attacks to deal a portion of its damage in an area in front of it.

==Mechanics==
&lt;section begin=Cleave Intro /&gt;[[File:Cleave.png|thumb|250px|{{H|Sven}} cleaving through a creep wave.]]
Cleave causes the unit's attack to deal damage in a [[wikipedia:trapezoid|trapezoid]] in front of the attacking unit. The damage is based on the unit's [[Attack damage#Total Attack Damage|total attack damage]] values. Cleave can only be used by {{Symbol|Melee}} melee units, {{Symbol|Ranged}} ranged units cannot cleave by default.
{{#ifeq:{{BASEPAGENAME}}|Cleave|[[File:Cleave area.png|250px|thumb|Cleave damage is applied in a trapezoid shape.]]}}
Cleave does not affect the primary target, and it cannot [[miss]] when hitting secondary targets. However, a [[miss]]ed attack does not cleave.&lt;section end=Cleave Intro /&gt; Cleave hits [[invisible]], but not [[hidden]] or [[invulnerable]] units, and does not work against [[wards]] and [[buildings]].

===Stacking===
Multiple sources of cleave on the same unit work fully independently of each other. Each source applies its full damage within its area, without interacting with the other cleave sources.

;Example 1
: {{H|Sven}} with level 4 {{A|Sven|Great Cleave}}, has level 4 {{A|Magnus|Empower}} buff and {{I|Battle Fury}} would deal 3 different instances of cleave damage on each attack to units, with each instance using its own starting radius, distance and end radius in front of him.

===Ability Draft===
{{Main|Ability Draft}}
&lt;section begin=ad /&gt;{{Symbol|Ranged}} Ranged heroes are unable to cleave. The cleave-granting ability either has its cleave part disabled for them, or the ability is unobtainable by them. An attack is classified as {{Symbol|Melee}} melee when the attack does not rely on projectiles.

If a game mode allows ranged heroes to obtain the normally unobtainable cleave abilities (e.g. [[Ability Draft]]), these cleave sources (e.g. {{A|Kunkka|Tidebringer}} and {{A|Sven|Great Cleave}}) fully work for them. The cleave area, just like for melee heroes, is based on the attacking unit's position and happens on attack hit. This means the cleave damage is always applied in front of the attacking hero, even when the target was much further away.&lt;section end=ad /&gt;

===Damage===
Cleave's damage type is [[physical]] and is entirely based on the unit's [[Attack damage#Total Attack Damage|total attack damage]] ([[damage manipulation|before reductions]]). Its damage pierces [[spell immunity]] and is fully affected by [[damage manipulation]]. 

While cleave damage is considered spell damage, certain flags are applied to it:
* [[No-spell-lifesteal flag]], preventing its damage from utilizing [[spell lifesteal]].
* [[No-spell-amplification flag]], preventing its damage from being amplified with [[spell damage amplification]].

===Area of Effect===
[[File:Cleave area.png|200px|thumb|{{A|Sven|Great Cleave}} area of effect visualized.]]
The area of effect for cleave sources is shaped like an [[wikipedia:Isosceles trapezoid|isosceles trapezoid]]. This trapezoid is in front of the attacking unit, so that the attacking unit is always at the center of the shorter side of the trapezoid.

Double the starting radius equates to the length of the shorter side of the trapezoid, the cleave distance equates to its height, and double the ending radius equates to the long side parallel to the short side of the trapezoid.

===Attack Modifier Interactions===
{{Main|Attack modifier#Common Attack Modifiers|l1=Attack Modifier}}
Although cleave is an attack modifier, it works independently on itself and does not interfere with any other attack modifier.

For example, the armor reducing effect of [[Attack modifier#Corruption|Corruption]] applied to the primary attacked target does not increase the cleave damage, despite the target receiving extra damage from armor reduction. However, if an attack modifier increases the [[Attack damage#Total Attack Damage|total attack damage]] (e.g. [[Critical Strike]]), it affects the cleave damage. 

Some abilities which grant [[Attack damage#Conditional Attack Damage Bonus|conditional attack damage bonuses]] may or may not be included in the cleave damage. The following is a list of abilities that are taken into account by cleave:

{{Talent bonus table|Cleave|cleave}}

==Splash==
&lt;section begin=Splash Intro /&gt;Splash is in some ways the ranged version of cleave. It works similarly as cleave, with the main difference being the damage is typically dealt in a circle around the attacked unit, instead of a trapezoid in front of the attacking unit.

Splash does not affect the primary target, and it cannot [[miss]] when hitting secondary targets. However, if an attack misses, no splash damage is applied within the radius. Splash damage works with [[attack modifier]]s the same way as cleave does.&lt;section end=Splash Intro /&gt;

Just like cleave, splash also works for {{Symbol|Melee}} melee heroes. {{H|Doom}} is able to acquire {{A|Ancient Black Dragon|Splash Attack}} from {{U|Ancient Black Dragon}} (with {{Symbol|Talent}} {{A|Doom|Devour}}).

===Splash Sources===
{{SkillListHead|title=Abilities Granting Splash Attacks}}
{{SkillListLite
| source = Ancient Black Dragon
| name = Splash Attack
}}
{{SkillListLite
| source = Dragon Knight
| name = Elder Dragon Form
}}
{{SkillListLite
| source = Fountain
| name = Fountain Damage
| nametext = Splash Attack
}}
{{SkillListLite
| source = Tiny
| name = Tree Throw
}}
{{SkillListLite
| source = Tiny
| name = Tree Volley
}}
{{SkillListTail}}

==Other Sources==
Besides Cleave and Splash, there are some unique attack-based area damage abilities that share some similarities with cleave and splash, or with each other.

===Tree Grab===
[[File:Tiny Tree Grab area.png|200px|thumb|{{A|Tiny|Tree Grab}} area damage visualized.]]
{{SkillListHead}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Tiny
| name = Tree Grab
| trait1 = Area Damage Length
| value1 = {{Show|A|Tiny|Tree Grab|value2}}
| trait2 = Area Damage Radius
| value2 = {{Show|A|Tiny|Tree Grab|value3}}
| trait3 = Attack Damage as Area Damage
| value3 = {{Show|A|Tiny|Tree Grab|value8}}
}}
{{SkillListTail}}

Tree Grab shares several similarities with cleave. Its damage is calculated based on {{H|Tiny}}'s [[Attack damage#Total Attack Damage|total attack damage]]. It also considers [[armor]] value, [[Armor#Defense Class|defense classes]], and deals [[physical damage]]. 

The biggest difference to cleave is how its damage area is calculated. While cleave sources is shaped like an isosceles trapezoid, Tree Grab's area is a semicircle on top of a rectangle. The ability's area is also locked on Tiny, being in front of him, no matter how far away the attack target is.
{{clr}}

===Psi Blades===
[[File:Templar Assassin Psi Blades area.png|200px|thumb|{{A|Templar Assassin|Psi Blades}} area damage visualized.]]
{{SkillListHead}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Templar Assassin
| name = Psi Blades
| trait1 = Spill Area Width
| value1 = {{Show|A|Templar Assassin|Psi Blades|value2}}
| trait2 = Spill Length Multiplier
| value2 = {{Show|A|Templar Assassin|Psi Blades|value3}}
| trait3 = Attack Damage Spilled
| value3 = {{Show|A|Templar Assassin|Psi Blades|value4}}
}}
{{SkillListTail}}
Psi Blades causes {{H|Templar Assassin}}'s attack to damage enemies behind the attacked target. The spill damage is based on how much exactly the primary attack target took, and is dealt as [[pure]] damage to units behind it. The damage counts as spell damage, but it ignores [[outgoing spell damage amplification]] and cannot [[spell lifesteal]].

The spill area has a rectangular shape, with a width of {{Show|A|Templar Assassin|Psi Blades|value2}} and has a length of &lt;code&gt;{{Show|A|Templar Assassin|Psi Blades|value3}} × [[Attack range|ΣAtkRange]]&lt;/code&gt;. The spill area can be further increased by other attack range bonuses. Templar Assassin's position is checked as the projectile hits the target, not upon launching.

{{Quotation|Storm Spirit|I grow stronger!|sound=ss level 01.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Experience&lt;/dfn&gt;'''&lt;sub&gt;XP&lt;/sub&gt;''' is an element heroes can gather by killing enemy units, or being present as enemy units get killed. On its own, experience does nothing, but when accumulated, it increases the hero's level, so that they grow more powerful. Only heroes can gather experience and therefore reach higher levels.

With each level gained, a hero's base attributes increase by static values, which makes them stronger in several ways. Heroes may also learn new [[Ability|abilities]] upon leveling up, or improve already learned spells onto higher levels, making them more powerful. {{Symbol|Talent}} [[Talents]] may also be learned on certain levels, which further improve the hero's stats or abilities.

==Leveling==
Each hero begins at level 1, with one free ability point to spend. Heroes may level up by acquiring certain amounts of experience. Upon leveling up, the hero's {{Symbol|Strength}} / {{Symbol|Agility}} / {{Symbol|Intelligence}} [[attributes]] increase by fixed amounts ([[Table of hero attributes|unique for each hero]]), which makes them overall more powerful. Heroes may also gain more ability points by leveling up, allowing them to learn new abilities, to improve an already learned ability, making it more powerful or to gain additional attributes. On certain levels, ability points may also be spent for {{Symbol|Talent}} [[talents]], which further improve their stats or abilities. Ability points do not need to be spent immediately, a hero can level up multiple times while saving the ability points.

&lt;!--[[File:XP by Level.png|thumbnail|Experience required for each level.]]--&gt;
The amount of experience required to level up increases for each level. There is no specific formula for this requirement, but rather just set values for each individual level. Heroes can gain a total for 29 levels, resulting in level 30 as the highest possible level a hero can reach.

==Acquiring Experience==
Experience is awarded in a {{G|xp radius}} radius when an enemy hero dies to any ally, or when an enemy non-hero unit (creeps or summons) dies to any allied or neutral creep. This experience is shared between all allied heroes within the area, [[wikipedia:Floor and ceiling functions|truncated]] and splitting evenly amongst them. Therefore, the more heroes there are, the less every individual hero gets, and if no hero is nearby, the experience is effectively lost or wasted. Additionally, heroes that are already level 30 still take their share of experience within range, also effectively wasting experience.

Dying units do not grant any experience if they have [[Reincarnation]]. Dying summons or [[illusion]]s do not grant any experience if their duration runs out naturally.

Heroes must be alive to gain experience. Other status effects, such as [[spell immunity]], [[invulnerability]], and being [[hidden]], do not prevent a hero from gaining experience.

===Exceptions===
Except {{A|Meepo|Divided We Stand|text=Meepo Clones}} and the {{A|Vengeful Spirit|Vengeance Aura|text=Vengeance Illusion}}, hero [[clones]] and [[illusions]] do not gain any experience, and are not considered by the experience sharing. 

; {{H|Meepo}}
{{#lst:Meepo|xpshare}}

; {{A|Vengeful Spirit|Vengeance Aura|text=Vengeance Illusion}}
The Vengeance Illusion is considered an allied hero within the area. Experience is shared and split evenly amongst her and her allies.

===Hero Kills===
Hero kills give experience in an area as well, splitting it up amongst all present heroes. However, unlike non-hero kills, hero kills always grant experience to the hero of the player who killed them, regardless of distance. This means when a player kills an enemy hero while outside the experience range (with a global spell, or with units under their control), but has an ally within the experience range of the killed enemy hero (regardless of any actual contribution to the kill), the experience is split between the killing player's hero, and the hero of the allied player who was within range of the kill.

Experience granted by heroes is determined by the following values and formula:&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:hero xp base|{{G|xp hero base}}}}&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:hero xp factor|{{G|xp hero factor}}}}&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:hero xp formula|{{G|xp hero base}}+{{G|xp hero factor}}}}

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
! class="header" width="225px" | Hero Kills Base XP
! class="header" width="225px" | Factor XP
|-
| {{XP|{{G|xp hero base}}|}}
| {{G|xp hero factor}}
|}

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="{{ValueColor/El|XP}};"&gt;Bounty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;XP&lt;/sub&gt; = (&lt;span style="color:{{ValueColor/El|XP}};"&gt;{{G|xp hero base}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;XP&lt;/sub&gt; + {{G|xp hero factor}} × DeadHero&lt;sub&gt;XP&lt;/sub&gt;) / n + &lt;span style="color:{{ValueColor/El|XP}};"&gt;Streak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;XP&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

This means for every {{XP|{{#expr:1/{{G|xp hero factor}} round2}}}} the dying hero has, their experience bounty increases by {{XP|1}}, starting with a base experience of {{XP|{{G|xp hero base}}}}.

The following table shows the experience bounty ranges based on the level of the killed hero. The experience bounty does not increase past level 25.

===Streak Values===
Additionally, if the killed hero had a killing streak going on, bonus experience is awarded for killing them, on top of the default experience values. This experience bonus depends on the killed hero's level.

Streak Value Bonus Experience does not increase past '''beyond &lt;font color='#FF8100'&gt;GODLIKE'''&lt;/font&gt;.

The streak experience bounty is defined by the following formula:

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;f(x) = ({{G|kill streak xp multiplier 1}}x&lt;sup&gt;{{G|kill streak xp exponent}}&lt;/sup&gt; - {{G|kill streak xp multiplier 2}}x + {{G|kill streak xp base}}) × L&lt;/span&gt;

The following bonuses are granted for ending a streak:

===Denying===
{{Main|Denying}}
When a hero gets denied (be it by allies or by the hero itself), {{#expr:{{G|hero deny factor}}*100}}% no experience is awarded to enemies around it. This also applies to heroes killed by neutral creeps.

When other player-controlled units get denied, {{#expr:{{G|summon deny factor}}*100}}% experience is awarded to the enemy either. Summons dying to neutral creeps do not count as denied and grant their default experience bounty.

When a lane creep gets denied, the enemy gets {{#expr:{{G|creep deny factor}}*100}}% of its {{XP|Experience|i}} bounty, instead of 100%. Lane creeps dying to neutral creeps do not count as denied and grant their default experience bounty.

==Other Experience Sources==
Most creeps have a fixed experience value they grant. This includes [[lane creeps]] and most [[summoned units]]. [[Buildings]] do not grant any experience.

[[Neutral creeps]] have each a unique base value, which stays the same throught the match, although neutral creeps that spawned by getting stacked have a 15% penalty on their experience bounty. {{U|Roshan}}'s experience bounty increases by {{Show|A|Roshan|Strength of the Immortal|value8}} every {{Show|A|Roshan|Strength of the Immortal|value4}} minute. Neutral creeps always grant experience to both teams, no matter who kills them, splitting it evenly amongst all present heroes.

{{TOC float|right}}
&lt;section begin=intro/&gt;Buildings are a type of unit that are not controlled by any player. At the beginning of a match, a set of buildings spawn at set locations in both teams' bases. Both [[factions]] have the same set of buildings, with only their appearance differing from each other. Buildings take mostly defensive roles and are the main objective of the game.

Besides the bases, there are several neutral buildings scattered throughout the map that can be conquered, or be otherwised used by both teams.&lt;section end=intro/&gt;

==Neutral Buildings==
{{Main|Neutral Buildings}}
{{#lst:Neutral Buildings|intro}}

==Faction Buildings==
&lt;section begin=faction/&gt;All faction buildings have the same base properties. They are immune to most abilities and can be only affected by a few abilities.

When destroyed, some buildings grant a team {{Gold|Gold}} bounty, and some grant bounty to the player who made the last hit. A building with less than {{#expr:{{G|building deny health}}*100}}% of its max [[health]] can be denied, to reduce or prevent the enemy team from obtaining gold bounties. However, the [[Building#Ancient|Ancients]] cannot be denied.

Buildings do not grant [[experience]]. Once destroyed, a building is permanently lost and does not respawn.

There are a total of 26 buildings for each faction.&lt;section end=faction/&gt;

==General Information==
{{Main|Attack Damage|l1=Attack Classes}}

===Backdoor Protection===
[[File:Dota 2 map backdoor protection.jpg|thumb|350px|Backdoor Protection areas.]]

'''Backdoor Protection''' is a passive ability most destroyable buildings have. This protection makes it difficult for players to destroy or even damage buildings without the presence of lane creeps. While active, Backdoor Protection reduces the [[Damage manipulation|incoming damage]] received while [[healing]] the building based on the damage dealt by enemy units, making them difficult to destroy. The ability deactivates itself when an enemy [[lane creep]] moves within the deactivation radius, [[Dominate]]d creeps do not deactivate this ability. Once deactivated, Backdoor Protection takes some time for the ability to activate again.

There are currently four areas that deactivate Backdoor Protection, and each of them functions independently of the other.

Although the backdoor protection ability is visible on each building within the base, they are all controlled by the [[Building#Ancients|Ancient]]'s Backdoor protection. If enemy creeps are within its huge detection radius, all buildings within the base lose their protection.

Each {{U|Tower (Tier 2)}} has its deactivation radius. When one of them is disabled, the others are not. The Tier 2 Towers' Backdoor Protection is also independent of the Ancients' Backdoor Protection.

Backdoor protection is not responsible for the [[invulnerability]] buildings have, so the buildings still stay invulnerable if their corresponding towers are not destroyed first.

===Glyph of Fortification===
[[File:Dota 2 Glyph of Fortification preview.jpg|thumb|250px|A Glyphed tower.]]
[[File:dota 2 minimap buttons player.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Glyph button, located on the right of the minimap.]]
[[File:dota 2 minimap buttons spectator.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The button is split for spectators, showing both team's cooldowns at the same time.]]

Glyph of Fortification (or '''Glyph''' in short) is an ability usable by any player that causes all friendly buildings and [[lane creeps]] to become impervious to damage for a short duration, while also granting [[Buildings#Towers|Towers]] above {{U|Tower (Tier 2)}} a multishot attack, allowing them to attack multiple enemies at the same time. 

The effect has a rather low duration and very high cooldown, making the timing of usage very important. The Glyph is used strategically to stop enemy pushes or slow them down long enough to organize a defense. It may also be used offensively to secure a push by granting the creep waves damage immunity at the right time, or even for finishing enemies off by using the multishot attacks.

The Glyph of Fortification can be activated by any player with a button at the right of the [[minimap]] or a {{Key press|Hotkey}} defined in the settings. The Glyph's cooldown is shared by the entire team, meaning if one player uses it, it goes on cooldown for all players of the team.

** Does not grant invulnerability, therefore, it does not prevent [[instant kill]] sources (e.g. {{A|Axe|Culling Blade}} etc.) from killing affected units.

* Causes Towers to perform [[instant attacks]] on the closest {{#explode:{{#var:Glyph of Fortification value1}}|/|1}} enemies whenever it launches an attack projectile.
** This means all projectiles are released at the same time together with the main attack. It does not matter whether the primary attack [[miss]]es.
** The extra projectiles travel at the same speed as the leading attack's projectile.
** Does not target the following units:
*** [[Wards]] and other buildings.
*** [[Invisible]], [[attack immune]] or [[untargetable]] units, and units inside the [[Fog of War]].
** However, attacking wards or buildings still causes the secondary projectile to hit valid targets within the radius.

&lt;section begin=towers/&gt;'''Towers''' are the main line of defense for both [[faction]]s, attacking any non-neutral enemy unit that gets within their range. Both factions have all three lanes guarded by three towers each.

Additionally, each faction's Ancient has two towers as well, resulting in a total of 11 towers per faction. Towers come in 4 different tiers:
* {{U|Tower (Tier 1)|text=Towers (Tier 1)}}: located at the end of each lane.
* {{U|Tower (Tier 2)|text=Towers (Tier 2)}}: located halfway through each lane.
* {{U|Tower (Tier 3)|text=Towers (Tier 3)}}: located on top of the 3 ramps at each base.
* {{U|Tower (Tier 4)|text=Towers (Tier 4)}}: located in pairs in front of each [[Buildings#Ancient|Ancient]].&lt;section end=towers/&gt;

All Towers have an innate [[invulnerability]] before the lower tier tower preceding it in its lane is destroyed. {{U|Tower (Tier 1)|text=Towers (Tier 1)}} are invulnerable before the game begins. [[Barracks]] do not have to be destroyed to make {{U|Tower (Tier 4)|text=Towers (Tier 4)}} vulnerable. Both Tier 4 Towers must be destroyed to remove the [[Buildings#Ancient|Ancient]]'s invulnerability.

===Attack Priority===
[[File:Dota 2 tower range preview.jpg|thumb|200px|Range indicator, appears when a player approachse a tower.]]
[[File:Dota 2 tower range safe preview.jpg|thumb|200px|If the tower is already attacking, the indicator is yellow.]]
[[File:Dota 2 tower targeting preview.jpg|thumb|200px|Targeting indicator, appears when the tower just &lt;ab&gt;weapons_tower_tower_aggro.mp3&lt;/ab&gt; targeted the player.]]
[[File:Dota 2 tower targeting safe preview.jpg|thumb|200px|If the tower switches away, the effect plays on the new target in yellow.]]
Towers have multiple criteria for the selecting their next attack target. If multiple heroes are within its attack range and the tower wants to choose a new target, these are the conditions it is looking for.


;Condition 1 - Unit type:

* Towers have the following unit type priorities:
*# Heroes and non-hero units alike
*# {{U|Siege Creep|text=Siege Creeps}}
*# {{M|buildings}}
*# {{M|ward-type unit}}

The unit type of all enemies within attack range is being checked continuously. If the tower is currently attacking a unit of a lower priority, and a unit of higher priority comes within attack range, the tower immediately switches to that unit.


;Condition 2 - Threat level:

* Towers check for the target's current threat:
*# Units that directly attack the tower
*# Units that attack an ally of the tower
*# Units that are idle or are casting abilities

Unlike the unit-type check, the threat check only applies to units within {{G|tower guard radius}} range of the tower, and only happens once upon choosing the next attack target. If the target's action changes after it has already been chosen, the tower sticks to the target regardless.


;Condition 3 - Distance:

* If multiple units meet the same previous criteria, they are chosen based on proximity; the closest unit is chosen.


;Special behavior 1 - Manual de-aggro:

* If a unit is being attacked by a tower, issuing an attack order on another allied unit causes the tower to immediately choose a new target.
** This only works if there is another allied hero that is closer to the tower than the unit.
** The order alone is enough to trigger this, the attack does not have to be initiated.
** Even if the order gets canceled immediately, the de-aggro is still triggered.
** Note that the unit-type priority condition still applies. A unit with a higher priority cannot switch aggro to a unit with lower priority.
** A tower can only be de-aggroed once every {{G|tower aggro cooldown}} seconds this way.
** This behavior also applies to the {{U|Fountain|text=Fountains}} and to [[lane creeps]].


;Special behavior 2 - Protective towers:

* Towers are coded to protect heroes from other heroes.
** If a hero is within {{g|tower protect radius}} range of a tower, and is attacking another hero, the tower immedaitely switches to the attacking hero.
** Only triggers on regular attacks, manual attacks and auto-attacks alike. {{M|Instant attacks}} do not trigger this.
*** Does not trigger when manually casting an {{M|active attack modifier}} on an hero, but does trigger if auto-cast is used.
** Only protects heroes, including {{M|illusions}}, {{M|clones}}, and the {{U|Spirit Bear}}.
** Only protects against heroes, including illusions, clones, and {{M|creep-heroes}}.
** &lt;b&gt;Note that the factions of the attacking and attacked heroes do not matter!&lt;/b&gt;
*** An enemy tower can be aggroed by actively {{M|denying}} an allied hero, or when being forced to attack allies through a {{M|taunt}}.
*** This counteracts the previous manual de-aggro special behavior.
*** While the manual de-aggro triggers upon attack order, the protective behavior triggers upon order and attack begin.
*** Therefore, when denying an ally, the tower initially de-aggros upn giving the attack order, and re-aggros upon beginning an attack.
** This behavior also applies to [[lane creeps]], but not to {{U|Fountain|text=Fountains}}.

===Visual Indicators===
When approaching a tower, a section of the tower's attack range slowly becomes visible, starting to fade in when about 600 range away from it. The closer the player gets, the more it becomes visible. When standing in front of it, the effect appears like a bending wall. If the tower is already attacking, the effect appears yellow instead.

Upon crossing the wall, the entire attack range circle becomes visible. If the target starts attacking the player, a red line appears, pointing from the tower to the player, along with an &lt;ab&gt;weapons_tower_tower_aggro.mp3&lt;/ab&gt; audio cue, warning the player that the tower is targeting them. If the tower switches away from the player, the effects turn yellow, and the targeting effect plays again, on the new target.

These effects are all client-sided, each player sees them differently.

===Tower Bounty===
All 3 types of Tower Bounty grant unreliable gold. [[Turbo Mode]] has a building {{Gold|Gold}} bounty multiplier of {{G|turbo mode factor}}.

* {{A|Buildings|Backdoor Protection}}.

===Lane Creep Upgrades===
{{See also|Lane Creeps}}
Barracks are [[invulnerable]] until their respective {{U|Tower (Tier 3)}} defending them is destroyed. The loss of Barracks does not prevent [[lane creeps]] from spawning but upgrades them instead.

==Trivia==
* In DotA, {{A|Buildings|Glyph of Fortification}} grants allied buildings [[spell immunity|magic immunity]] and 9999 [[armor]], instead of 100% incoming damage reduction.
** Due to how the game rounds up damage values, this resulted in all attacks still dealing 1 damage to the building.
** The magic immunity also prevented spells that usually affect buildings from affecting them.
** In earlier versions of DotA, Glyph did not grant spell immunity, and spells such as {{A|Pugna|Nether Blast}} could deal damage through it.

* In DotA, the {{M|Radiant}} are called [https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Sentinels The Sentinel], the primary army of the {{wc3|Night Elf|text=Night Elves}}.
** As such, all of the Radiant (Sentinel) buildings are Night Elf structures:
*** The {{U|Tier 1 Tower|text=Towers}} use the model and name of the {{wc3|Ancient Protector|text=Ancient Protectors}}.
*** The {{U|Melee Barracks}} use the model and name of the {{wc3|Ancient of War|text=Ancients of War}}.
*** The {{U|Ranged Barracks}} use the model and name of the {{wc3|Ancient of Lore|text=Ancients of Lore}}.
*** The {{U|Effigy Building|text=Effigy Buildings}} use the model and name of the {{wc3|Moon Well|text=Moon Wells}}, and there are 11 of them.
*** Besides these, there are more filler buildings in DotA:
**** Two {{wc3|Ancient of Wind|text=Ancients of Wind}}, located behind the top and bottom barracks. They have 900 health and 5 armor.
**** Two {{wc3|Hunter's Hall|text=Hunter's Halls}}, located further behind the Ancients of Wind. They have 1100 health and 5 armor.
*** The {{U|Fountain}} uses the model {{wc3|Fountain of Health}}, and is named &lt;i&gt;Well of Life&lt;/i&gt;.
**** It is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; [[invulnerable]]; It has 50000 health and 0 armor, and can be attacked and destroyed.
*** The {{U|Ancient (Building)}} is called &lt;i&gt;The World Tree&lt;/i&gt;, and uses a custom model of the [https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/World_Tree World Tree], whose creator is unknown.
***: The model can be found [https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/tree-of-life-wtv2_86.245215/ here].

* In DotA, the {{M|Dire}} are called [https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Scourge The Scourge], one of the three major {{wc3|Undead}} factions in the Warcraft universe.
** As such, all of the Dire (Scourge) buildings are Undead structures:
*** The {{U|Tower (Tier 1)|F=Dire|text=Towers}} use the model and name of the {{wc3|Spirit Tower|text=Spirit Towers}}.
*** The {{U|Melee Barracks|F=Dire}} use the model and name of the {{wc3|Crypt|text=Crypts}}.

*** The {{U|Fountain|F=Dire}} uses the [https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Fountain_of_Health#Origins defiled] version of the {{wc3|Fountain of Health}}, and is named &lt;i&gt;Defiled Fountain of Life&lt;/i&gt;.
**** It is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; [[invulnerable]]; It has 50000 health and 0 armor, and can be attacked and destroyed.

[[File:Vision zeus moving.gif|thumb|Vision changes around while the hero moves.]]
{{Quotation|Monkey King|Oh, nice view!|sound=vo_monkey_king_monkey_ability1_16.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Vision&lt;/dfn&gt; describes what a unit can and cannot see within a circular area from its current location and state. Places a unit cannot see are filled with the Fog of War, a dark mist that hides enemy units inside of it. Allied units cannot be hidden by the fog of war. Invisible units cannot be seen even when outside of the Fog of War, unless they are revealed by a source of [[True Sight]]. Trees and higher elevation block a unit's vision if it has ground vision. Flying vision is unobstructed by trees and elevation. Abilities can grant vision over areas as well, usually for a short amount of time and limited to their area of effect.

All vision is shared within a team, which means that everything allied units see can be seen by the player as well. This includes allied player-controlled units, as well as NPC units, like [[lane creeps]] and [[buildings]].

__TOC__
==Fog of War==
All areas outside of friendly vision are constantly covered by the &lt;dfn&gt;Fog of War&lt;/dfn&gt;. Any non-friendly units within the Fog of War cannot be seen or directly targeted, however they can still be hit by non-targeted spells. To unveil units in the Fog of War, an allied unit must gain vision over that area.

If an enemy enters the fog of war during the [[cast time]] of an ability, the cast gets canceled. However, attacks do not cancel if their targets enter the fog of war during the [[attack animation]].

===Elevation===
{{Main|Map#Terrain|l1=Terrain}}
[[File:Vision demo elevation.gif|thumb|Units cannot see areas that are on higher elevations than them.]]
The Dota 2 map's cliffs and valleys shape the battle, determining both where units can move and what they can see. Units with ground vision cannot see areas that are on higher elevation than them. For example, a unit standing in the [[river]] (which is the on the lowest elevation) cannot see anything past the cliffs surrounding the river, or beyond the ramps leading out of the river.

On the other side, units standing on higher elevation effectively have unobstructed vision on lower elevation. For example, a unit standing on an elevated ward spot can see the entire surrounding, unobstructed by nearby trees, regardless of their vision type.

Units with flying vision do not have their vision obstructed by higher elevations.

===Trees===
{{Main|Trees}}
[[File:Vision demo tree.gif|thumb|Amount of vision blocked by single tree changes based on proximity to it.]]
Besides blocking pathing, [[trees]] also block vision for units on the same elevation as them, and for units one elevation above them. Trees block vision like how objects cast shadows: The closer the object is to the source of light, the bigger and wider the object's shadow gets. The closer a unit is to a tree, the more vision is blocked by the tree, blocking out an entire section of the circular vision area of the unit. The exact numbers for these are unknown.

The small trees created by {{I|Iron Branch}}, {{I|Ironwood Tree}}, {{I|Woodland Striders}}, and {{A|Nature's Prophet|Sprout}} have a narrower vision blocker than the regular trees on the map.

Units with flying vision do not have their vision obstructed by trees.

===Vision Blockers===
{{Main|Buildings#Fountains|Roshan#Roshan_Pit|l1=Fountain|l2=Roshan}}
Artificial vision blockers exist at certain locations, which control visibility in addition to the normal rules. All sources of [[Vision#Flying Vision|flying vision]] are unaffected by vision blockers.

{{SkillListHead|title=Vision Blocker Sources}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Drow Ranger
| name = Glacier
| notes = Creates a hill of ice beneath {{H|Drow Ranger}}. The front of the hill obscures the enemy's vision while granting allied heroes on top [[flying vision]].
}}
{{SkillListTail}}

====Fountain Entrances====
Both [[fountain]]s have a vision blocker at their stairs, preventing the enemies of that fountain's team from seeing into the fountain area from outside. This is normally redundant, since the fountain's higher elevation already prevents vision, but it also prevents vision from nearby higher-elevation ground, such as the {{M|Radiant}} fountain [[ward]] cliff.

====Roshan Pit====
[[File:Roshan phantom spots.png|right|thumb|&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;Green tiles&lt;/span&gt; can see in, but cannot be seen from inside. &lt;span style="color:#ff0000;"&gt;Red tiles&lt;/span&gt; can see out, but cannot be seen from outside.]]
{{U|Roshan}}'s pit is sealed by vision blockers that prevent vision both into and out of the pit.

However, the pit entrance also has phantom spots, areas in which vision is asymmetric. Units standing in these areas can either see into the pit while being unseen from inside, or see out of the pit while being unseen from outside. These may be useful for juking, scouting Roshan attempts, and for hiding [[wards]], most notably {{A|Templar Assassin|Psionic Trap|text=Psionic Traps}}. With [[Vision#Ground Vision|ground vision]], units on phantom spots can only be seen by standing within 3 tiles of them (in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry rectilinear distance]).

In-game, the phantom spots are not marked. To tell when you've stepped into a phantom spot, look for a subtle brightning of a small area of ground around you. This indicates you have direct vision of some phantom spot tiles, implying you are in a phantom spot yourself. The right side of the pit entrance has the largest continuous phantom spot, so it is the most forgiving location for this.

==Time of Day==
{{Main|Time of day|l1=Time of Day}}
The current [[time of day]] affects vision. Most units' vision range is shorter at night and higher by day. Exceptions exist, with some units having shorter day vision and longer night vision, and some having the same vision regardless of time.

==Base Vision Ranges==
Most units have day and night vision, only very few have absolutely no vision. These values can be altered with vision bonuses and reductions.

There are 2 types of vision, ground vision (also known as obstructed vision) and flying vision (also known as unobstructed vision). Ground vision is impaired by higher elevations, trees, and vision blockers, while flying vision is completely unhindered.

Every hero has ground vision. Other units have the following vision types
{{Grouped attribute table|unit|vision_type|value heading=Vision Type}}

==Modifying Vision==
Several abilities and items can grant or reduce vision. Most of these vision bonuses stack additively unless stated otherwise.

===Vision Increasing Sources===
A unit can have a maximum vision range of 4000 as shown in the example below.

==Sources of Vision==
Units are not the only entities with vision. A lot of abilities are able to create vision cells of varying sizes on the world, revealing an area of a fixed duration.

===Caster Vision===
[[File:Caster vision.png|thumb|Caster vision granted over {{H|Bane}} to his enemies for casting {{A|Bane|Brain Sap}} on them.]]
Caster vision is a vision cell granted to the victims of targeted spells and attacks. Whenever a unit casts a spell (except {{A|Spirit Breaker|Charge of Darkness}}) on an enemy within 1800 range, or performs an attack on them, the enemy gains 150 radius ground vision around the casting or attacking unit which lasts for 2 seconds. This vision prevents players from easily and constantly harassing enemies from the fog of war, especially with long-distant spells that can be spammed easily like {{A|Skywrath Mage|Arcane Bolt}}, or with ranged attacks.

Only one of these vision cell can exist per unit. This means if a vision cell already exists from a previous targeted order, performing another targeted order within the previous vision cell's duration does not create a second vision cell. Instead, the location of the previous vision cell gets updated, its duration gets reset, and its vision type is changed to flying vision.

Caster vision is also applied upon launching an attack. The result of the attack does not matter, if the attack is executed, the vision is granted.

===Shared Vision===
Some abilities are capable of sharing an enemy unit's vision the player's team. This means anything that unit sees can also be seen by its opponents.

==Exposing==
Several abilities can expose an enemy's model through the fog of war, without truly providing vision over them. This means the Fog of War still shrouds their surroundings, but they are visible and targetable as if they were not within the Fog of War. Exposed enemies are treated as visible units by abilities.

&lt;section begin=Exposing /&gt;Exposing an enemy does not cancel out the effects of [[invisibility]], although it does make their silhouette visible. An exposed invisible enemy has its location revealed, and can even be selected like a visible enemy, but is still almost fully treated as an invisible unit. This means it still cannot be targeted by attacks or single-targeted abilities, and still counts as invisible in terms of abilities affecting them, with very few exceptions. Some sources of exposure also provide [[True Sight]] to fully reveal the enemy, but not all do.&lt;section end=Exposing /&gt;

==True Sight==
true sight placeholder

==Vision interaction with spells==
Generally, unit-targeted spells require vision over the target, while ground targeted or non-target spells may be cast regardless of vision. Once cast, a spell usually works regardless of vision. Area effects usually do not require vision to affect enemies. Some non-targeted spells that do the targeting themselves may require vision over enemies. There are exceptions to all of these.

The following spells require vision over enemies to affect them

Disables come in many different varieties, and most Heroes have access to some form of disable. Sometimes "disabled" or "fully disabled" refer to stun.

{{Footnote|1|Does not prevent turning.}}
{{Footnote|2|Certain abilities can still be cast while stunned if stated in ability notes, e.g. {{Symbol|Aghanim}} {{A|Ursa|Enrage}}.}}

==Stun==
{{Main|Stun#Mechanics|l1=Stun}}
Stuns are the most common and most dependable kind of disable. {{#lst:Stun|Intro}} 

It also interrupt all [[channeling]] abilities, such as using {{A|Town Portal Scroll|Teleport}}. In general, stuns can be categorized into three types, with each using a different modifier to stun the target(s). Stuns from the same group use the same modifier, therefore they refresh each others' duration based on when they affect the target and do not extend its stun duration.

{| {{#lst:Stun|Definition}} |}

Certain stun abilities requires the caster to [[channel]] the ability in order to stun the affected target(s), or it applies negative effects onto the caster themselves. These abilities mostly use the [[Stun#Unique Modifier|Unique Modifier]] (e.g. {{A|Enigma|Black Hole}} and {{A|Bane|Fiend's Grip}}).

===Sleep===
{{Main|Sleep}}
{{#lst:Sleep|Intro}} Some sources of [[Sleep]] provides [[invulnerability]] (e.g. {{A|Bane|Nightmare}}), while some do not (e.g. {{A|Elder Titan|Echo Stomp}}).

===Cyclone=== 
{{Main|Cyclone}}
{{#lst:Cyclone|Intro}} While being lifted up into the air, other units can pass below it. Sources of [[Cyclone]] are {{A|Invoker|Tornado}} and {{I|Eul's Scepter of Divinity}}.

==Slow==
{{Main|Movement speed#Reductions|Attack speed#Reductions|l1=Movement Speed Slow|l2=Attack Speed Slow}}
&lt;section begin=Slow Description /&gt;A type of status effect that reduces the afflicted units movement speed by a percentage, and/or attack speed by a flat value of their current speeds. In general, slows from different sources stack with each other, but multiple of the same instance do not, but refresh their duration instead. There are some exceptions to this.&lt;section end=Slow Description /&gt;

{| class="wikitable" width="70%" style="text-align:center;"
! style="width:20%;" | Slow
! style="width:60%;" | Disabled Aspect / Definition
! style="width:20%;" | Examples
|-
! [[Movement speed#Reductions|Move Speed Slows]] 
| style="text-align:left;" | 
* Reduce a unit's movement speed by a percentage of its speed.
* Currently, there are no sources of movement speed slow which reduce a unit's movement speed by a fixed value. A unit affected by a [[haste]] is immune to movement speed slowing effects.
| {{A|Brewmaster|Thunder Clap}}
|-
! [[Attack speed#Reductions|Attack Speed Slows]]
| style="text-align:left;" | 
* Reduce a unit's attack speed by a fixed value and stacks additively.
* Currently, there are no sources of attack speed slow which reduce a unit's attack speed by a percentage value. There is no effect which grants a unit immunity to attack speed slows either.
| {{A|Jakiro|Liquid Fire}}
|}

==Ability and Item Disables==
{{Main|Silence|Break|Mute}}

{| {{#lst:Silence|Definition}} |}

===Hex===
{{Main|Hex}}
Hex applies multiple types of disables  – [[silence]], [[mute]] and [[disarm]] on the affected target and set its movement speed to a fixed value. {{#lst:Hex|Intro}} Sources of Hex are {{A|Lion|Hex}} and {{I|Scythe of Vyse}}.

==Forced Movement==
{{Main|Forced Movement#Mechanics|l1=Forced Movement}}
{{#lst:Forced Movement|Intro}}

{| {{#lst:Forced Movement|Definition}} |}

==Root==
{{Main|Root#Mechanics|l1=Root}}
{{#lst:Root|Intro}}

{| {{#lst:Root|Definition}} |}

===Leash===
{{Main|Leash}}
{{#lst:Leash|Intro}}

The mechanics for Leash sources works differently depending on the ability, and are detailed in its respective ability notes. For example, affected heroes leashed within {{A|Puck|Dream Coil}} duration are stun if they move too far from the leashed point; {{A|Slark|Pounce}} heavily slows the leashed hero when it tries to move away from the leashed point etc.

==Trap==
{{Main|Trap}}

A trap hinders a unit from moving, similar to how cliffs hinder a unit from moving. These abilities either create an impassable obstacle, or create a [[Trap#Barriers|barrier]] or a leash which prevent units from passing by heavily slowing the unit if it tries to pass through.

{| {{#lst:Trap|Definition}} |}

==Taunt==
{{Main|Taunt}}
{{#lst:Taunt|Intro}}

{| class="wikitable" width="70%" style="text-align:center;"
! style="width:20%;" | Mechanic Type
! style="width:60%;" | Disabled Aspect / Definition
! style="width:20%;" | Examples
|-
! [[Taunt]]
| style="text-align:left;" | 
* Forces the affected unit to drop any of its current order, and start attacking the taunting unit instead.
* If the taunted unit is out of [[attack range]], it moves towards the taunt source until within attack range.
| {{A|Winter Wyvern|Winter's Curse}}
|}

When affected by [[Taunt]] and [[Fear (Game Mechanic)|Fear]], Taunt takes priority.

===Fear===
{{Main|Fear}}
{| {{#lst:Fear (Game Mechanic)|Definition}} |}

==Hide==
{{Main|Hide}}
{{#lst:Hide|Intro}}

==Disarm==
{{Main|Disarm}}
{{#lst:Disarm|Intro}}
A disarm prevents the affected unit from attacking. It still can be attacked by other units. Sources of Disarm are {{A|Invoker|Deafening Blast}} and {{I|Heaven's Halberd}}.

===Ethereal===
{{Main|Ethereal}}
{{#lst:Ethereal|Intro}} Sources of Ethereal are {{I|Ghost Scepter}} and {{A|Pugna|Decrepify}}.

==Blind==
{{Main|Blind}}
{{#lst:Evasion|Blind Intro}} Blinds work fully independently from [[evasion]]. Sources of Blind are {{A|Keeper of the Light|Blinding Light}} and {{A|Tinker|Laser}}.

==Disabling Orders==
Stuns (including Shackle, [[Sleep]] and [[Cyclone]]), [[Forced Movement]], [[Hide]] and [[Taunt]] effects do not prevent the player from giving orders to their units. The given order is executed by the unit as soon as the disable expires. There are only very few abilities which can be cast normally while affected by these disables:

However, some disables prevent giving orders to units. They also prevent casting the aforementioned abilities. 

[[File:Disabled orders error messages.png|thumb|200px|The error messages from silence, mute, root and general order disable.]]
When an order is prevented, the player cannot even select a target in case of targeted orders like a [[Abilities#Unit Target|unit-targeted ability]]. In such case, the order remains selected (i.e. a unit-targeted ability stays selected when attempting to cast it while silenced, and the player has to manually deselect it). 

When giving orders is disabled, a red on-screen error message appears, telling the player why the order cannot be given. The text is usually accompanied by an error sound. The message and sound varies based on the disable.

The following status effects disable giving orders:
{| class="wikitable" width="70%" style="text-align:center;"
! style="width:20%;" | Status Effects
! style="width:60%;" | Disabled Aspect / Definition
! style="width:20%;" | Examples
|-
! [[Ethereal]]
| Fully prevent ordering attacks on the Ethereal Unit.
| {{A|Pugna|Decrepify}}
|-
! [[Fear (Game Mechanic)|Fear]]
| Runs away from caster towards a certain direction and fully prevent any orders.
| {{A|Shadow Fiend|Requiem of Souls}}
|-
! [[Hypnosis]]
| Pulled towards caster and fully prevent any orders.
| {{A|Lich|Sinister Gaze}}
|-
! [[Leash]]
| Limited movement capabilities and fully prevents ordering certain abilities.
| {{A|Slark|Pounce}}
|-
! [[Mute]]
| Fully prevent item cast orders, except ability casts.
| {{A|Doom|Doom}}
|-

| Rooted on spot and fully prevents ordering certain abilities.
| {{A|Crystal Maiden|Frostbite}}
|-
! [[Silence]]
| Fully prevent any abilities order, except item casts.
| {{A|Silencer|Global Silence}}
|}

Besides the named disables, the prevention of giving orders is also partly a disable on its own. Several abilities completely prevent the player from giving the affected units any order, while the disable the ability uses does not. The following abilities fully prevent giving orders:
{{SkillListHead}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Brewmaster
| name = Primal Split
}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Lifestealer
| name = Infest
| notes = The caster may only be ordered to use {{A|Lifestealer|Consume}} while Infested.

{{SkillListRich

}}
{{SkillListRich

}}

==Trivia==
{{Main|Pause}}

Pause was an effect that completely rendered the target unable to move, attack, cast spells or items, disabled most passive abilities and caused buffs and debuffs to not tick down for the duration. It also prevented it from gaining experience.

* Examples of pause were {{A|Faceless Void|Chronosphere}}, {{A|Outworld Destroyer|Astral Imprisonment}}, and {{A|Shadow Demon|Disruption}}.

{{Quotation|Bounty Hunter|You can't fight what you can't see.|sound=vo_bounty_hunter_bount_ability_windwalk_04.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Invisibility&lt;/dfn&gt; is a status effect that causes the unit to not be seen by the enemy, even when within their range of vision, allowing the unit to scout, spy on, and ambush enemies by sneaking through their lines. However, enemies can counter this by acquiring [[#True Sight|True Sight]].

==Mechanics==
[[File:Invisible hero.png|thumb|Invisible units appear transparent to enemies with [[True Sight]] and to allies.]]
An invisible unit is unselectable for the enemy team, and also [[attack immune]] against them. They are also flagged as invisible, which causes many different interactions with several abilities.

Invisibility triggers a [[disjoint]] upon getting applied. This is a one-time event that happens once upon turning invisible, and not periodically over the entire duration. Applying another invisibility on top of an existing one triggers a disjoint. However, the disjoint does not trigger if the enemy has [[True Sight]] over the unit (unless it possesses True Sight Immunity). Losing True Sight does not cause a disjoint, even if it was preventing an invisibility.

The ways to lose the invisibility are dependent on the ability or item that granted it. Generally, with very few exceptions, it is lost upon reaching the [[attack point]] during an attack, or upon reaching the [[cast point]] during the use of an ability or an item. This means that abilities with extended effects, i.e. {{A|Luna|Eclipse}} or {{A|Sand King|Epicenter}}, do not cancel the invisibility upon each beam or pulse. [[Channeling]] abilities do not cancel it either after the channeling started.

Multiple sources of invisibility can be independently applied, and the unit remains invisible as long as at least one of these sources is active.

Some invisibility sources also make the unit [[phased]].

===Appearance===
Invisible units are not rendered for the enemy team, so that they cannot see them at all. Their [[minimap]] icon stops showing up for them as well.

To allies of the unit, and to enemies that have [[True Sight]] over the unit, the unit appears transparent, but still visible. They can be selected and attacked normally, and are not treated as invisible by abilities. On the minimap, their marker appears as a ring with a pointer, instead of a full circle with a pointer.

To enemies that have [[shared vision]] over the unit, its silhouette becomes visible, while the model itself is still invisible. The unit can be selected, but still cannot be targeted by abilities and attacks.

Invisible units do not cast shadows, neither to enemies nor to allies.

===Fade Delay===
The &lt;dfn&gt;fade delay&lt;/dfn&gt; is an initial delay that, as the name suggests, delays invisibility. During the delay, no effects of invisibility are present; The unit is fully visible and is not considered invisible. Therefore, the unit can perform any actions during the delay as usual.

However, if the unit attacks or casts an ability or an item, the fade delay gets reset, delaying the invisibility even more. Once the fade delay elapses, the unit may enter the next phase, which can either be the fade time, or the invisibility right away.

A fade delay is usually used by abilities that continuously re-apply the invisiblity over a duration, where a fade delay ensures a downtime if the invisibility gets broken.

===Fade Time===
The &lt;dfn&gt;fade time&lt;/dfn&gt; is a transitional phase between the visible and invisible state. During it, the unit's model gradually turns transparent over the duration, but they are not considered invisible yet.

The fade time is always a fixed duration, and cannot be altered by anything. This means, unlike during the fade delay, the unit can still perform any action normally during the fade time, without resetting it or breaking the invisibility. Once the fade time elapses, the unit becomes truly invisible, at which point orders may break it, depending on the source ability.

A fade time is usually used by abilities that apply invisibility only once per cast, adding an initial transition towards invisibility.

===Attack Behavior===
While invisible, and also during the fade time, a unit never auto-attacks nearby enemies regardless of [[Game settings#Game|auto-attack settings]], even if the unit is revealed by True Sight and being attacked. attack orders given to the unit before turning invisible turns into a move order, only direct attack orders given while already invisible are carried out normally.

This does ''not'' apply to the fade delay. As previously mentioned, the unit can perform any actions during the fade delay as usual, resetting the delay with each executed attack. Attack orders given before a fade delay still get carried out, and may even cancel the following invisibility, depending the attack's timing.

==True Sight==
[[File:Riki invisible revealed.jpg|150px|thumb|An invisible {{H|Riki}} revealed by the True Sight of a [[Tower]]]]
&lt;dfn&gt;True Sight&lt;/dfn&gt; is a negative status effect that renders the effects of invisibility null. A unit affected by True Sight is no longer considered invisible to them, until the True Sight status effect is removed. This means they can be selected and targeted normally, and are not treated as invisible units by abilities anymore.

True Sight is not to be confused with [[Expose|exposure]]. While True Sight directly works against invisibility, exposure only reveals their silhouette and makes them selectable again. They remain untargetable, attack immune, and are still treated as invisible by abilities.

==Invisibility interactions with other spells==
{{See also|Disjoint#Invisibility|Disjoint#Disjointable projectiles|l1=Disjointing with invisibility|l2=Disjointable projectiles}}

===Targeting invisible units===
Most spells which affect an area usually affect invisible units as well, with some exceptions. Single target spells cannot target invisible units without the help of [[True Sight]]. Although [[shared vision]] renders the unit's model visible even during invisibility, it is not enough to allow single target spells to target them.

Spells which choose specific or random targets on cast behave inconsistently with invisibility. This includes all bouncing spells (e.g. {{A|Zeus|Arc Lightning}}) and multi-target spells like {{A|Dazzle|Poison Touch}} and {{A|Tinker|Heat-Seeking Missile}}.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Requires a {{Symbol|Talent}} [[talent]]. When upgraded, these spells can target secondary units, but ignore invisible ones.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; These spells choose a new target if their current target dies. They do not choose invisible targets.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; {{A|Grimstroke|Soulbind}} does not bind the target to their invisible allies, but keeps the link up if an already bound unit turns invisible.&lt;/small&gt;

{{SkillListHead}}
{{SkillListRich

| notes = Always hits the triggering unit, even when invisible. Does not hit other nearby invisible enemies.
}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Queen of Pain
| name = Shadow Strike
| notes = When choosing the area talent, Shadow Strike does target invisible enemies within the area, but the projectiles get instantly disjointed.
}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Zeus
| name = Thundergod's Wrath
| notes = Does target invisible enemies, but the damage and lightning require vision. Therefore, only the vision and true sight is applied around invisible enemies.
}}
{{SkillListTail}}

===Turning invisible after cast===
For most spells, it does not matter if the target turns invisible after the spell's effect already have begun. Their effects continue normally, regardless of the invisibility. There are exceptions to this.

All sources of invisibility [[disjoint]] projectiles. Even a split-second of vision loss caused by invisibility is enough to disjoint projectiles, even when regaining vision of the unit before the projectile reaches it. This disjoint does not happen when having [[#True Sight|True Sight]] over the unit.

Besides disjointed projectiles, the following spells behave differently when their targets turn invisible while they are active.

{{SkillListHead}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Axe
| name = Berserker's Call
| notes = When the caster turns invisible, taunted enemies can be given one order until the effect expires. After finishing that order, the unit freezes in place until the effect expires.
}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Ember Spirit
| name = Sleight of Fist
| notes = When an already marked unit turns invisible before it gets slashed, it gets completely skipped if it still is invisible on its turn.
}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Grimstroke
| name = Phantom's Embrace
| notes = When a phantom's target turns invisible, the phantom instantly dies.
}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Huskar
| name = Life Break
| notes aghs = When the caster turns invisible, taunted enemies can be given one order until the effect expires. After finishing that order, the unit freezes in place until the effect expires.
}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Medusa
| name = Mystic Snake
| notes = If the snake's current target is invisible on impact, the snake does not affect it, and does not count the jump.
}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Undying
| name = Tombstone
| notes = When the zombies' target turns invisible, the zombies instantly die.
}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Weaver
| name = The Swarm
| notes = When a beetle's target turns invisible, the beetle instantly dies.
}}

&lt;dfn&gt;Lifesteal&lt;/dfn&gt; heals the attacking unit while damaging an enemy. Certain [[attack modifier]]s that deal damage in a single instance as the attack damage may conditionally Lifesteal. A unit can gain Lifesteal from abilities, [[items]] or {{Symbol|Talent}} [[Lifesteal#Talent|talents]] granting percentage-based values (e.g. {{I|Morbid Mask}}).

===Total Lifesteal===
&lt;section begin=intro /&gt;Percentage-based lifesteal sources from [[items]], abilities, and {{Symbol|Talent}} [[talent]]s stack independently and additively of each other after the sources' respectively creep lifesteal multiplier. All lifesteal sources are summed up, then [[lifesteal amplification]] is applied to the unit's lifesteal value as a multiplier. All lifesteal manipulation sources stack multiplicatively of each other.

The heal value from lifesteal is based on a percentage of the [[Attack Damage#Total Attack Damage|total physical attack damage]] dealt to the attacked unit from the attacking unit. Therefore, if an attack damage instance exceeds the target's {{tooltip|current|(Current) / Max}} health and kills it, the heal value is based on the attack damage value the dying target would have received if it had not [[Death|died]]. Lifesteal heals more on [[critical strike]] procs and works conditionally on certain [[attack modifiers]].

Neither heals from [[magical]] attack damage sources (e.g. {{I|Monkey King Bar}} procs) nor [[spell damage]] sources of all [[damage type]]s. Lifesteal only heals from [[physical]] and [[pure]] attack damage.

[[Instant attack]]s hitting secondary targets can heal from lifesteal as long as attack modifiers work with the instant attack source.

However, the heal value from lifesteal is not affected by most [[damage manipulation]] effects on the attacked target (e.g. {{A|Undying|Flesh Golem}} or {{I|Aeon Disk}}). For example, for [[illusions]], their heal value from lifesteal is based on their {{Symbol|Outgoing Damage Manipulation}} [[outgoing damage manipulation]] values (i.e. total attack damage of the illusion), but the heal value from attacking illusions is not affected by the {{Symbol|Incoming Damage Manipulation}} incoming damage manipulation values (i.e. attacking illusions).

There are currently no limits to how much a unit can heal from lifesteal.&lt;section end=intro /&gt;

Percentage-based lifesteal sources from items heals for {{#expr:{{G|item lifesteal creep factor}}*100}}% of their usual value when attacking creeps. Treats attack against [[clones]], [[illusions]] and [[creep-heroes]] as heroes, attacks against {{U|Roshan}} as creeps.

Calculating the total lifesteal value of a unit involves using a few values and a multiplier and can be defined as:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{Treelist}}
* Total Lifesteal
** ± Lifesteal Sources
*** × Creep Lifesteal Multiplier
** + Shared Lifesteal Sources
*** × Creep Lifesteal Multiplier
*** × Source Lifesteal Amplification
** × Wielder [[Lifesteal Amplification]]

===Equations===
The amount of healing granted from lifesteal to the attacking unit is calculated by a percentage of the 

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Heal = [[Attack Damage#Total Attack Damage|Total Attack Damage Dealt]] × Total Lifesteal-%based&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Lifesteal = Self Lifesteal Amplification × &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;([[Lifesteal#Sources|Lifesteal]]-%based × Creep Multiplier)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(Source Lifesteal Amplification × [[Lifesteal#Psuedo-Lifesteal|Shared Lifesteal]]-%based × Creep Multiplier)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

[[File:Monkey King Mischief abilityicon dota2 gameasset.png|frame]]
{{Quotation|Nature's Prophet|I speak for the trees.|sound=vo_furion_furi_spawn_01.mp3}}
&lt;section begin=intro /&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;Trees&lt;/dfn&gt; are a prominent terrain feature in Dota 2. They make up a large amount of the map and are very prominent in the forests that separate the lanes and border the map. Trees block vision and are normally impassable.&lt;section end=intro /&gt;

==Mechanics==
[[File:tree_size.png|thumb|300px|Trees on the Navigation Mesh.]]
Trees cannot be targeted by normal attacks and most abilities, except for a handful of abilities (e.g. {{A|Monkey King|Tree Dance}}).

&lt;section begin=collision /&gt;Despite the varying appearance and apparent size of the various trees, all permanent trees have an block size of a {{G|tree collision size}}x{{G|tree collision size}} unit square.&lt;section end=collision /&gt;

* Strictly speaking, trees do not have collision size. They are driven by the clip mesh like impassable terrain, affecting the navigation grid square it contacts.

The [[console command]] to respawn all destroyed trees on the map is &lt;code&gt;dota_treerespawn&lt;/code&gt; (requires cheats to be turned on).

===Respawn Time===
Trees regrow {{#expr:{{G|tree respawn time}}/60}} minutes after they were destroyed except if a unit is standing within {{G|tree respawn radius}} range of where they would spawn. In this case, the tree respawns once the unit gets out of range. This is to prevent the unit from getting stuck in the trees.
{{SkillListHead|title=Modifying Tree Respawn Time}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Treant Protector
| name = Eyes In The Forest
| trait1 = Set Respawn Time
| value1 = {{Show|A|Treant Protector|Eyes In The Forest|value4}}
| notes = Respawns all trees globally upon acquiring item.&lt;br&gt;Passively set the respawn time of all natural trees, does not affect [[Trees#Planted Trees|planted trees]]. This is [[innate]] to {{H|Treant Protector}}, and requires Eyes In The Forest to be unlocked.
}}
{{SkillListTail}}

===Tree Count===
[[File:Trees.jpeg|thumb|300px|Trees on the {{M|Radiant}} and {{M|Dire}} sides of the map.]]
Each tree has a &lt;code&gt;ent_dota_tree&lt;/code&gt; classname in the {{tooltip|map entity file|dota.vpk/maps/dota/entities/default_ents.vents_c}}. There are currently '''2357''' trees in the map since [[{{Updates|version}}]]. The {{M|Radiant}} has a total of 8 different types of assorted Bamboo Tree, Oak Tree, and Pine Tree in use, with a total of 1215 trees; while the {{M|Dire}} has 3 types of trees currently in use, with a total of 1142 trees.

Almost every [[items|item]] in Dota 2 can be dropped, allowing other [[heroes]] (including enemys) to take it , or for the hero to give it to their allies. Despite that, most items cannot be shared with other heroes: the hero who bought an item is considered its owner, and only they can use, sell, or upgrade it. If it ends up in someone else's [[Head-up_display#Inventory|inventory]], the item will be [[Silence#Mute|muted]].

However, most [[consumables]] are &lt;dfn&gt;completely shareable&lt;/dfn&gt; as they cannot be upgraded, and only grant temporary effects. These can also be used by heroes that do not own them. This allows support heroes to purchase items to share with their team.

Some permanent items are '''partially shareable''': other heroes can benefit from their effects when holding them, but cannot sell or upgrade them. {{I|Divine Rapier}} and {{I|Gem of True Sight}} are special, in that they drop on death and can also be used by enemies.

Finally, to prevent abuse, certain items are disabled on the {{U|Animal Courier (Unit)}}.

==Completely Shareable==
{{Item cost list start}}

{{Item cost label|Dust of Appearance}}
{{Item cost label|Healing Lotus}}
{{Item cost label|Great Healing Lotus}}
{{Item cost label|Greater Healing Lotus}}
{{Item cost label|Block of Cheese}}
{{Item cost label|Observer Ward}}
{{Item cost label|Sentry Ward}}
{{Item cost label|Observer and Sentry Wards}}
{{Item cost label|Smoke of Deceit}}
{{Item cost label|Tango (Shared)}}
{{Item cost list end}}
Details:
* Neutral Token can be shared even if you have already looked at what neutral items are available to choose from, but have not yet chosen one of them. The ally will have their own unique set of items to choose from.

===Roshan Items===
{{Item cost list start}}
{{Item cost label|Cheese}}
{{Item cost label|Aghanim's Blessing - Roshan}}
{{Item cost label|Refresher Shard}}
{{Item cost label|Roshan's Banner}}
{{Item cost list end}}

==Partially Shareable==
{{Item cost list start}}
{{Item cost label|Bottle}}
{{Item cost label|Healing Salve}}
{{Item cost label|Enchanted Mango}}
{{Item cost label|Divine Rapier}}
{{Item cost label|Gem of True Sight}}
{{Item cost label|Town Portal Scroll}}
{{Item cost list end}}
Details:
* {{I|Bottle}} containing a {{M|Runes|text=rune}} cannot be dropped.
* {{I|Healing Salve}} and {{I|Enchanted Mango}} can be shared if they are dug up using {{I|Trusty Shovel}}. If you buy the same item in a store while having a dug-up item, they will be mixed and you can transfer both items at once.
* {{I|Divine Rapier}} works like an unshareable item until an enemy team to the item owner picks it. After that happens, it can be used by anyone, but can only be dropped after current owner dies.
* {{I|Town Portal Scroll}} can be dropped only through the main inventory, which is possible only via {{U|Courier}}s.

==Cooldown interactions==
While the cooldown of {{I|Tome of Knowledge}} is bound to the user, other items follow these rules:
* All Items of the same type in the user's inventory, backpack, and stash go on cooldown when any of them is used, independent of their owner or shareability.
:: For example, if you have 2 stacks of {{I|Dust of Appearance}}—one of your own and one of a teammate, using either one will put both on cooldown.
* If a hero receives an item type that would be on cooldown for them, it is placed on cooldown, independent of its owner or shareability.
:: For example, if you have 2 {{I|Dust of Appearance}}, use 1, then receive an unused Dust from a teammate, both will be on cooldown.
* An Item that is on cooldown retains its cooldown, even when given to a Hero that hasn't used it.
:: For example, if a teammate has 2 {{I|Dust of Appearance}}, uses one {{I|Dust of Appearance}} and gives the rest to you, it will be on cooldown for you too.
* All items that merge into an existing stack of them will assume the same cooldown as the stack which was first in the inventory.
:: For example, you buy a stack of {{I|Dust of Appearance}} and give it to a teammate, who uses it, then drops it.
::: If you buy another stack of Dust ''before'' picking up the first Dust stack, the merged stack will ''not'' be on cooldown.
::: However, if you pick up that first Dust, it will be on cooldown. Any additional Dust you buy will merge with that stack, and also be on cooldown.

[[File:Dual Breath icon.png|frame]]
&lt;dfn&gt;Abilities&lt;/dfn&gt; are unique skills that [[heroes]] and [[creeps]] have access to on the battlefield. They range from simple passive effects, to devastating explosions of energy, to complex, terrain changing feats. All heroes have four or more abilities, three or more basic abilities and an ultimate ability, that they can assign ability points to every time they level up. Every level in an ability makes it more powerful, sometimes increasing its mana cost as well.

Abilities can consume [[mana]], and may also be placed on cooldown when used. Abilities that are on cooldown cannot be used until their cooldown timer is up, at which point they can be cast again. Abilities with low cooldowns are sometimes referred to as "spammable" abilities, because they can be used very frequently.

Every time a hero levels up, they earn an ability point, until their abilities are fully upgraded. The player can then spend the point to unlock one of the hero's abilities, or to upgrade an already learned ability. At the start of the game, all of a hero's abilities are locked, but they each start with one ability point which can be used at any time. Abilities cannot be used and do not have any effect if they are still locked. After an ability is unlocked, it can be upgraded several times. Basic abilities can be upgraded 3 more times, for a total of 4 levels, and a hero's ultimate ability can be upgraded 2 times, for a total of 3 levels at hero level 6/12/18.

The exceptions to this are:
* {{H|Invoker}}, who can upgrade his basic abilities 6 times (total of 7 levels).
* {{H|Meepo}}, who can upgrade his ultimate abilities on levels 4/11/18(3/10/17/24 with More Meepo).

Upgrading abilities will make them more effective. Depending on the ability, upgrading the ability may increase the amount of damage, increase the duration of an ongoing effect such as a [[disable]], or otherwise improve the ability.

Sometimes, upgrading abilities will also increase or decrease the mana cost. For example, each level in {{H|Earthshaker}}'s {{A|Earthshaker|Fissure}} increases the damage it deals and the duration of its stun, but also increases its mana cost.

Besides directly leveling abilities, there are a few other ways to make abilities more powerful. [[Spell Amplification]] is a mechanic which increases the amount of damage of abilities slightly. {{I|Aghanim's Scepter}} and {{I|Aghanim's Shard}} are special items which can enhance each hero in a unique way. Depending on the hero, it may enhance the power of their ultimate ability, improve one or more basic abilities, or in some cases, Aghanim's Scepter or Aghanim's Shard even grants an entire new ability.

Some heroes also have an ability that improves their other abilities further. For example, {{H|Ogre Magi}}'s {{A|Ogre Magi|Multicast}} makes his other 3 abilities more powerful.
{{clr}}

==Basic Abilities==
Basic abilities can be upgraded to a new level once every 2 levels. This means that a level 2 hero cannot upgrade a learned basic ability to level 2. Every 2 levels, a hero increases his maximum basic ability level by 1. Ultimate abilities can only be upgraded every 6 levels, starting from level 6. These ultimate abilities are usually more powerful than a hero's basic abilities.

==Ultimates==
A hero's last ability, which can usually be trained at level 6, level 12, and level 18, is called an ultimate. There is only one exception to this level restriction: {{H|Meepo}}'s {{A|Meepo|Divided We Stand}}, which can instead be upgraded at levels 4, 11, and 18 or 3, 10, 17 and 24 with More Meepo.

Ultimates can be high-impact abilities that define a hero's strengths and playstyle; they often have a devastating effect and a long cooldown. In some cases however, they are not the main strength, but just synergize very well when combined with the other abilities. Some ultimates have a lower effect but are spammable due to a relatively short cooldown. Ultimate abilities can also be passive abilities.

==Sub-abilities==
Some abilities comes together with sub-abilities. These extra abilities usually do nothing on their own and mostly are only active after the ability they come with was cast first, or in some cases, they serve as a set-up for other abilities. 

Their tasks range from activating the effects of other abilities on demand, manipulate abilities or even fully cancel them when desired. Usually, these abilities are innate, or are unlocked after learning specific abilities. 

Since these abilities usually have a very low or no cooldown at all, they usually do not trigger abilities which react on ability usage, like {{I|Magic Wand}}-based items' charge gain or {{A|Silencer|Arcane Curse}}'s per ability cast penalty. Sub-abilities are automatically acquired with {{A|Rubick|Spell Steal}} or {{A|Morphling|Morph}} together with the main ability. If the caster does not have the required item (e.g. {{I|Aghanim's Scepter}} or {{I|Aghanim's Shard}}) for unlocking the sub-ability, the sub-ability does nothing.

==Transformation Abilities==
{{See also|Unit Size#Different Model|Hex|l1=Different Model}}
&lt;section begin=Transformation Abilities Intro /&gt;Transformation abilities generally change the hero's form while providing other stat bonuses, created [[illusions]] can benefit from the hero's current state with the remaining duration of the transformation buff. These abilities have a transformation time. Certain abilities may modify the hero's [[attack range]] ({{Symbol|Melee}} [[melee]] and {{Symbol|Ranged}} [[ranged]]) properties or other stats.

For {{A|Rubick|Spell Steal}} and {{Symbol|AD}} [[Ability Draft]], multiple transformation abilities' bonuses and reductions fully stack with each other:
* All attack damage bonuses.
* All [[movement speed]] effects (e.g. {{A|Lycan|Shapeshift}} [[haste]]).
* All [[attack modifier]]s.
* All health, mana (and regenerations) altering effects.
* Attack range definitions and notes fully apply.
* Items that use different values for {{Symbol|Melee}} [[melee]] and {{Symbol|Ranged}} [[ranged]] heroes (e.g. {{I|Manta Style}}) to now treat the caster's ranged type based on the ability notes.&lt;section end=Transformation Abilities Intro /&gt;

[[Hex]] sources are generally not considered as transformation abilities as these sources only [[Unit Size#Different Model|change]] the unit's current model.

==Ability Types==
An ability's type refers to how that ability's effects are applied.

&lt;small&gt;For abilities listed by their ability and targeting type, see [[Abilities/Abilities by type|''here'']].&lt;/small&gt;

===Active===
[[File:Ability border active.gif|thumbnail|Active]]
Active abilities must be used in order to apply their effects. Active abilities can consume mana, have cooldowns, and usually have some method of targeting related to them. The majority of abilities are active abilities. They can be activated by pressing their associated {{Key press|Hotkey}}. 

If an ability can target the caster, {{Key press|double}} the {{Key press|Hotkey}} causes them to activate immediately on the caster.

Active abilities are indicated by a bevel around the icon, which makes them look like a button. When an ability gets used and enters its [[cast animation]], the bevel turns green and the icon shifts, looking like a pressed button. When selecting a targeted ability, the icon and the bevel appear brighter until the ability gets deselected or the cast begins. Active abilities also have a hotkey displayed at the top left corner.

* Examples of active abilities are {{H|Weaver}}'s {{A|Weaver|Shukuchi}}, {{H|Ursa}}'s {{A|Ursa|Overpower}}, and {{H|Necrophos}}'s {{A|Necrophos|Reaper's Scythe}}.

===Passive===
[[File:Ability border passive.png|thumbnail|Passive]]
Passive abilities apply their effects either permanently as soon as they are learned, or activate by themselves if the ability is learned and its requirements met. These requirements can range from attacking a unit, casting a spell or even getting attacked. Most passive abilities do not consume mana and usually do not have cooldowns, exceptions include {{H|Wraith King}}'s {{A|Wraith King|Reincarnation}}. Most heroes have at least one passive ability, though not all do.

Passive abilities do not have a bevel and look like they are pressed into the hud. Since passive abilities cannot be used manually, their appearance never changes. Passive abilities only have an icon displayed upon learning.

* Examples of passive abilities are {{H|Wraith King}}'s {{A|Wraith King|Reincarnation}}, {{H|Crystal Maiden}}'s {{A|Crystal Maiden|Arcane Aura}}, and {{H|Drow Ranger}}'s {{A|Drow Ranger|Marksmanship}}.

===Autocast===
[[File:Ability border autocast.gif|thumbnail|Autocast]]
Autocast abilities are special active abilities that can be toggled on or off, or manually cast. 
* {{Key press|mouseright}} on ability to toggle autocasting on or off. 
* {{Key press|Alt|hotkey}} is the default hotkey to toggle autocasting on or off.

[[Disables]] such as [[silence]]s and [[stun]]s do not prevent a unit from toggling its autocast abilities on or off. However, autocast abilities cannot be used when silenced as with all other spells. Most auto-castable spells are active attack modifiers, applying a modification to the user's attacks when activated. When toggled on, the ability will apply whenever possible. For example, {{H|Drow Ranger}}'s {{A|Drow Ranger|Frost Arrows}} will be used whenever she attacks a target. When toggled off, they will not be used and will not consume mana. When an active attack modifier is manually cast, it is partially treated as a spell cast instead of as an attack. This causes nearby enemy creeps to not aggro when using them that way. This is also known as [[orb walking]].

Not all abilities with autocast are attack modifiers. A few of them are regular abilities, which, when toggled on, will automatically be cast when their requirements are met. An example of such is {{H|Ogre Magi}}'s {{A|Ogre Magi|Bloodlust}}. When toggled on, Ogre Magi will automatically cast Bloodlust on nearby allied heroes.

{{A|Doom|Devour}} is similar, but a special case, as toggling it on does not make {{H|Doom}} autocast Devour. Instead, the toggle state determines whether Doom will copy the target neutral creep's abilities or not. When toggled off, Doom does not acquire new neutral creep spells. When toggled on, he does.

Auto-castable abilities have almost the same appearance as regular active abilities. They also have a bevel which turns white when selected and green when casting. However, they do not turn green for attack modifiers. On top of that, they have a thicker second bevel behind the first bevel. This one glows orange when the ability gets set to autocast.

These are the only auto-castable active attack modifiers:

==Targeting Types==
Active abilities and autocast abilities are targeted in different ways, depending on the effects of the ability.

===No Target===
&lt;section begin=notarget /&gt;Abilities with no target requirement are immediately cast as soon as its button is pressed. Many of these abilities do not have a cast time. However, they do not have an {{Symbol|Instant Cast}} instant cast time. They cannot directly target a unit or a point. &lt;section end=notarget /&gt;They usually affect the caster or units around the caster. They can affect an area around the caster, or have a global effect.

* Examples of instant abilities are {{H|Mirana}}'s {{A|Mirana|Leap}}, {{H|Slardar}}'s {{A|Slardar|Slithereen Crush}}, and {{H|Zeus}}' {{A|Zeus|Thundergod's Wrath}}.

====Toggle====
Toggle abilities are always non-targetable. These abilities apply a periodic effect and often drain mana or health as long as they are toggled on. These effects can range from damaging or healing nearby allies, switching between attack types, and manipulating other abilities of the unit. If the toggle ability drains mana over time, it turns itself off once not having mana to support it anymore. They cannot be forcibly turned off by anyone but the player by pressing their button again. Like regular spells, they cannot be used (in this case, turned {{Key special|Onoff}}) while affected by disables which prevent ability usage. However, once they are toggled on, they persist through any form of disabling, including [[silence]].

All toggleable abilities have an {{Symbol|Instant Cast}} [[instant cast]] time by default.

{{SkillListTail}}

===Target Point===
[[File:Ability area target indicator.png|200px|thumbnail|Indicator of area target spells]]
&lt;section begin=targetpoint /&gt;Point-target abilities require the caster to target a point or an area.&lt;section end=targetpoint /&gt; Upon pressing the {{Key press|Hotkey}}, the cursor turns into a crosshair that determines where the ability will be cast, or in which direction it will be cast. Point targeting abilities can have very varying effects. For some abilities, it merely determines the direction to launch an effect, for other abilities it determines an exact point where an effect will be applied.

* Examples of point target abilities are {{H|Techies}}' {{A|Techies|Remote Mines}}, {{H|Spectre}}'s {{A|Spectre|Spectral Dagger}}, and {{H|Morphling}}'s {{A|Morphling|Waveform}}.

====Target Area====
Area target abilities work like point target abilities, with the only difference being that they require the caster to target a whole area, instead of a point. Upon pressing such a spell's button, the cursor turns into a targeted area indicator which shows the area the ability will affect. Upon cast, these abilities usually affect the whole targeted area, or all units in the area. Some apply their effects once upon cast, and some apply a lasting effect which affects units which enter the area after cast.

* Example of area target abilities are {{H|Crystal Maiden}}'s {{A|Crystal Maiden|Crystal Nova}}, {{H|Alchemist}}'s {{A|Alchemist|Acid Spray}} and {{H|Faceless Void}}'s {{A|Faceless Void|Chronosphere}}.

====Vector Targeting====
[[File:Swashbuckle targeting.png|200px|thumbnail|The vector targeting interface]]
A vector targeted spell requires two locations to be chosen. The first location determines the starting location of the spell, while the second location determines the direction. There are different ways to select the second location, based on which casting type is used:

* Regular cast: Select the ability with its hotkey. Then move the cursor to the desired start location and hold down the left mouse button. Now move the cursor to aim toward the desired direction. Release the left mouse key to select the direction.
* Quick cast on key up: Move the cursor to the desired start location, then press and hold the ability hotkey to set the start location. Now move the cursor to aim toward the desired direction. Release the ability hotkey to select the direction.
* Quick cast on key down: Move the cursor to the desired start location, then press the ability hotkey to set the start location. Now move the cursor to aim toward the desired direction. Press the left mouse button to select the direction.

===Target Unit===
&lt;section begin=targetunit /&gt;Target unit abilities require the caster to directly target a unit, and cannot be used on the ground.&lt;section end=targetunit /&gt; Upon pressing an ability's {{Key press|Hotkey}}, the cursor turns into a crosshair that determines on which unit the ability will be cast on. Most unit targeted abilities affect only the target. Abilities that apply their effect to a single unit are often called "single target abilities". When targeting a unit out of cast range, the caster follows the unit until it gets in cast range or the target cannot be targeted anymore (e.g. the target turns [[invisible]]).

* Examples of unit target abilities are {{H|Lina}}'s {{A|Lina|Laguna Blade}}, {{H|Vengeful Spirit}}'s {{A|Vengeful Spirit|Magic Missile}}, and {{H|Omniknight}}'s {{A|Omniknight|Repel}}.

While most target unit abilities require the caster to face to the direction of the target unit, the following abilities do not require facing target. They also have instant cast time.

===Combinations===
[[File:Ability unit target area indicator.png|300px|thumbnail|Indicator of unit target spells with area effect]]
Some of the targeting types can appear combined.

====Target Point or Unit====
Some point targeted abilities may also be able to directly target a unit. In such cases, the spell is cast towards the targeted unit's current location. If the target unit is out of cast range, the caster follows it until it is within range and casts the spell on the unit's position. Even when the target moves during the cast animation, the spell is still cast on it, or launched towards it if it is a traveling effect. This does not cause the spell's actual effects to home in on the target.

* Examples of point target abilities which can also target units are {{H|Sand King}}'s {{A|Sand King|Burrowstrike}}, {{H|Nature's Prophet}}'s {{A|Nature's Prophet|Sprout}}, and {{H|Lina}}'s {{A|Lina|Dragon Slave}}.

====Target Unit with Area Effect====
* A few single-target abilities have an effect which affects an area around the primary target. Like unit targeted abilities, these must be directly cast on units, and cannot be cast freely on any area. Such abilities have their own targeting cursor, which resembles the targeting cursor of ground targeted area spells. They have the same blue ring like area targeted spells, and have pulsing gapped rings which start at the center and move outwards. At the center, they have a small yellow reticule, indicating that a unit must be targeted.

* Examples of unit target abilities with area effects are {{H|Sven}}'s {{A|Sven|Storm Hammer}}, {{H|Oracle}}'s {{A|Oracle|Fortune's End}}, and {{H|Winter Wyvern}}'s {{A|Winter Wyvern|Winter's Curse}}.

==Cast Event==
A small number of spells react on abilities being cast, meaning they trigger certain effects when affected units cast abilities. Abilities reacting on spell casts are:
{{SkillListHead}}

{{Footnote|1|Does not react on abilities with no cooldown.}}
{{Footnote|2|Reacts on {{A|Puck|Phase Shift}}, despite it being listed below.}}
{{Footnote|3|Requires {{I|Aghanim's Shard}}.}}

For balance reasons, the following abilities do not trigger any on-cast event:
* [[Active attack modifiers]]
* [[Item]] abilities
* And the following listed abilities:
{{#lpdb:datapoint
| conditions = [[type::ability]] and [[extradata_is_oncastproced::!]] and [[extradata_game::]]
| template = SkillListLite
| starttemplate = SkillListHead
| endtemplate = SkillListTail
| order = pagename ASC
| limit = 1000
}}

There is one sub-ability and one active attack modifier which do trigger on-cast events. Whether they are intended to do so or not is unknown. This includes the following:
{{SkillListHead}}
{{SkillListLite
| source = Kunkka
| name = Return

{{SkillListLite

{{Quotation|Tusk|This next one is gonna sting.|sound=vo_tusk_tusk_superpunch_ready_02.mp3}}

&lt;dfn&gt;Critical strike&lt;/dfn&gt; is a passive ability that gives a chance to deal bonus damage on a successful attack.

==Mechanics==
[[File:Crit.png|thumb|250px|{{H|Wraith King}} performing a critical strike.&lt;br&gt;The red number displays the resulting physical damage before reductions.]]
A Critical Strike's occurrence is determined upon beginning an attack, and not upon attack launch or attack landing. 

For example, if the hero has {{I|Crystalys}} and it starts an attack that procs Critical Strike, the attack applies Crystalys' Critical Strike value regardless of if the item is being upgrade in the middle of the [[attack animation]]. Or when attacking an enemy affected by {{A|Bloodthorn|Soul Rend}}, and the debuff expires during an already started attack animation, that attack still applies the Critical Strike, since the attack started while the debuff was still present.

===Visual Feedback===
When a Critical Strike occurs, a red-colored number pops up on the victim of the strike, with a lightning bolt icon on the right side of the number. This number shows the multiplied damage value [[damage manipulation|before reductions]] or amplifications. Therefore, the displayed value does not equal the damage the target actually took from the attack.

===Multiplier===
&lt;section begin=Intro /&gt;An attack that triggers Critical Strike has its total damage value multiplied by the given multiplier of the source of the Critical Strike. This means a critical strike is basically an attack damage amplifier, as it does not add extra damage on top of the attack damage, but directly increases the damage of the attack by multiplying it.

It can be defined as
: &lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Critical Strike Multiplier = 1 + MAX C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The multiplier is applied before any [[Damage manipulation|reductions or amplifications]] on the target or on the attacking unit. It only counts the unit's [[Attack damage#Main Attack Damage|main attack damage]], plus any [[Attack Damage#Bonus Attack Damage|bonus attack damage]] (percentage and flat bonuses) it has, meaning any damage instances (i.e. [[Attack damage#Conditional Attack Damage Bonus|conditional attack damage bonuses]]) added to the attack damage which is separate from the attack damage itself is not considered by critical strikes. 

Therefore, if an ability adds its damage directly to the attack damage, then it may be considered by Critical Strike, though there are exceptions to this. See [[Attack damage#Total Attack Damage|total attack damage]] for the complete calculation.

All chance-based sources of Critical Strike use [[pseudo-random distribution]].&lt;section end=Intro /&gt;

===Stacking===
Multiple critical strike procs are rolled from the strongest to the weakest multiplier, and stop rolling once proc occurs, so that two critical strikes cannot proc on the same attack, resulting in a diminishing behavior. This means when having multiple sources of chance-based crits, and the one with a higher multiplier proc, that attack is not counted for the other critical strike sources, since they did not roll. Thus their pseudo-random distribution states are preserved: the unrolled weaker critical strikes' current proc chance is neither increased nor reset for this attack. 

For example, {{H|Tusk}}'s attack will not proc the critical strike of {{I|Daedalus}}' ({{Show|A|Daedalus|Critical Strike|value2}}) while casting {{A|Tusk|Walrus PUNCH!}} because the latter ability has a higher critical strike value of {{Show|A|Tusk|Walrus PUNCH!|value3}}.

With cooldown-based critical strike sources (e.g. {{A|Wraith King|Mortal Strike}}), this means that when a stronger value occurs, the cooldown-based critical strike stays unused and does not go on cooldown for that attack.

===Attack Modifier Interactions===
{{Main|Attack modifier|l1=Attack Modifier}}
Critical Strike fully stacks and does not interfere with any attack modifier. If an attack modifier increases or reduces attack damage, it is counted by the critical strike multiplier. 

Abilities that grant [[Attack damage#Conditional Attack Damage Bonus|conditional attack damage bonus]] may or may not be affected by the multiplier.

The following [[Attack modifier#Common Attack Modifiers|common attack modifiers]] is calculated after the critical strike, which increases the value during a proc/trigger:

* [[Lifesteal]] - Increases the amount lifesteal, not to be mixed up with [[lifesteal manipulation]].
* [[Cleave]] / [[Splash]] - Deals increased damage to all units within the cleave radius.

{{Quotation|Brewmaster|Having trouble seeing straight?|sound=vo_brewmaster_brew_ability_drunkenhaze_08.mp3}}
Evasion is mechanic that allows the unit to evade an incoming [[attack]].

All Evasion effects trigger upon landing an attack. This is upon projectile impact and upon [[attack point]] for {{Symbol|Ranged}} [[ranged]] and {{Symbol|Melee}} [[melee]] units respectively. Any attack or ability effects that relies on attacks to hit their targets do not trigger, including most [[attack modifier]]s and on-hit effects unless explicitly specified.

[[Evasion#True Strike|True Strike]] and [[Evasion#Accuracy|Accuracy]] are mechanics that nullifies Evasion.

|}

===Equations===
All evasion, blind, and accuracy sources are determined by [[pseudo-random distribution]].

Accuracy and Blind sources do not directly increase the attacked unit's evasion value, instead, they increase the effective evasion rate of the attacked unit for blind and lower it for accuracy. For effective evasion rate calculation purposes, multiple sources of evasion and accuracy stack diminishingly with each other respectively, while blind sources stack additively with each other and multiplicatively with evasion. 

The total evasion displayed on the [[HUD]] is defined as: &lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Evasion = 1 - &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(1 - [[Evasion#Sources|Evasion]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; )&lt;/span&gt;

The total blind is defined as: &lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Blind = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;[[Evasion#Blind|Blind]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The total accuracy is defined as: &lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Accuracy = 1 - &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(1 - [[Evasion#Accuracy|Accuracy]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; )&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;{{Treelist}}
* Incoming Attacks
** &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Accuracy Sources or True Strike Sources proc&lt;/span&gt;
** &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;Evasion&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;Blind&lt;/span&gt;
** Melee Buffer Range check
** Attack Hits
{{Treelist/end}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Effective Evade Chance = (1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;(1 - Total Evasion)&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;(1 - Total Blind)&lt;/span&gt;) × (1 - {{Symbol|Melee}} Melee Buffer Range Miss)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Final Hit Chance = 1 - Effective Evade Chance × (1 - &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

The formula written above is color-coded in sections, where &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; indicates the chance that accuracy does not proc, &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; indicates the total blind multiplier, and &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; for the evasion multiplier.

==Miss==
[[File:miss floating texts.png|thumb|200px|"Miss" appearing upon missing an attack,&lt;br&gt;"Evade" appearing upon getting missed.]]
Upon missing an attack on an enemy, a red floating text appears, reading &lt;code style="color:red;"&gt;MISS&lt;/code&gt;, visible to the attacking player only. The enemy, who was just missed by an attack, also sees a floating text, but in white and reading &lt;code&gt;EVADE&lt;/code&gt; instead. Furthermore, a missed attack does not play any of the attack impact sounds.

===Attack Range Type===
{{Main|Attack Range}}
For {{Symbol|Melee}} [[melee]] units, &lt;section begin=Melee Attack Buffer /&gt;if the target is farther than {{G|melee miss range}} range more than the melee unit's attack range, the attack 100% [[miss]]es, [[Evasion#True Strike|True Strike]] does not guarantee hits on units outside of the buffer range.&lt;section end=Melee Attack Buffer /&gt; 

{{#lst:Attack Range|Total Melee Attack Range}}

===Uphill Miss Chance===
For {{Symbol|Ranged}} [[ranged]] units without [[Flying Movement]], the uphill miss chance is conditionally applied upon a ranged attack projectile impact and not on the unit's attack point — &lt;section begin=Uphill Miss Chance /&gt;it causes {{#expr:{{G|uphill miss chance}}*100}}% of the ranged attacks to miss if the attacking unit is at a lower terrain level as the target, regardless of the terrain level difference. A unit is considered to be on higher elevated terrain when it is no longer visible to the player due to the terrain. When an enemy stands on a relatively higher ramp, uphill miss chance applies whether if the attacked unit is within [[vision]] or not.&lt;section end=Uphill Miss Chance /&gt; 

This means moving up onto an elevated area after an attack projectile has been launched may cause the projectile to miss on impact to uphill miss chance, even when both units were on the same ground level as the projectile was launched.

Uphill miss chance is considered an evasion source, it does not apply to {{Symbol|Melee}} units and units with flying movement.

===Cleave &amp; Splash===
{{Main|Cleave|Splash}}
{{#lst:Cleave|Cleave Intro}}
{{#lst:Cleave|Splash Intro}}

===Blind===
&lt;section begin=Blind Intro /&gt;Blind is a debuff that makes a unit miss upon attacking other units and sources of blind effects stack additively with each other, rendering an affected unit unable to land any attack.&lt;section end=Blind Intro /&gt; Although a combination of different blind sources can exceed 100%, for effective evasion rate calculation convenience, they can stack up to a maximum value of 100%.

Total Blind is defined as:

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Blind = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;[[Evasion#Blind|Blind]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

==Sources==
The following sources grant evasion and are determined by [[pseudo-random distribution]] as long as their value is neither 0% nor 100%. Evasion causes a unit to evade attacks of all kinds, while [[disjoint]]ing only evades projectile-based attacks. Sources that grant 100% evasion still stack diminishingly with other evasion sources despite the evasion value being 100%. These sources are still subjected to [[Evasion#Blind|Blind]] and [[Evasion#Accuracy|Accuracy]] multipliers like regular evasion sources.

The total evasion displayed on the [[HUD]] is defined as:

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Evasion = 1 - &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(1 - [[Evasion#Sources|Evasion]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; )&lt;/span&gt;

==Accuracy==
[[File:AccuracyDPS.png|thumb|300px|Average DPS increase of Accuracy against Evasion up to 35%.]]
Accuracy is applied as a debuff on the affected target. It does not directly increase the attacked unit's evasion value. For calculation purposes, the [[Evasion#Accuracy|accuracy multiplier]] can be considered as an evasion source as well.

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Accuracy = 1 - &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(1 - [[Evasion#Accuracy|Accuracy]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; )&lt;/span&gt;

True Strike sources can also be considered as outgoing accuracy.

===True Strike===
True Strike prevents the unit's attacks from missing, negating both evasion and blind sources against their target, including {{M|ward}}-type units and allied units, excluding {{M|Buildings}}. However, it does not apply an [[#Accuracy|Accuracy]] debuff on the attacked unit.

For {{M|ranged}} units, although True Strike prevents the unit's attack from missing, attack projectiles of ranged units with True Strike can still be {{M|disjoint|text=disjointed}}. For {{M|melee}} units, it also prevents the attacking unit's attack from missing when the attacked target moves more than {{G|melee miss range}} range away upon its {{M|attack point}}.

All attacks against {{M|Runes}} and against destroyable [[items]] have True Strike.

==Stacking==
Multiple sources of evasion stack diminishingly with each other, while sources of blind effects stack additively with each other and multiplicatively with evasion.

All evasion and accuracy sources are determined by [[pseudo-random distribution]].

A more concrete way of thinking about evasion stacking is that for an attack to bypass an evasion stack and hit, the attack should bypass each source of evasion in sequence. Only if all sources of evasion fail can the attack deal [[attack damage]]. Consider the chance to be hit, which is 1 - evade chance. A unit's chance to be hit is inversely proportional to its effective HP against attacks. Stacking multiple evasion sources is equivalent to multiplying their corresponding chance to hit. In this way, evasion's effectiveness can be understood to be stacking multiplicatively — while the actual chance to evade is diminishing, each source of evasion increases effective HP against [[physical attack]]s more than the last due to this multiplicative nature. This affects the following things:
* Applying a 50% evasion source while already having 35% evasion still doubles your effective hit points against physical attacks.
* Consequentially, a combination of evasion sources that are individually less than 100% is also less than 100%. There are currently a few abilities that grant 100% evasion (e.g. {{A|Arc Warden|Magnetic Field}} and {{A|Windranger|Windrun}}).

;Example 1
: '''Interactions between incoming attacks and Evasion.'''
: Incoming attacks to hit {{I|Butterfly}}'s wielder is {{#expr:(1-{{#vardefineecho:btf f|{{Show|I|Butterfly|bonus evasion}}/100}})*100}}%, because the item grants {{Show|I|Butterfly|bonus evasion}}% evasion.

: {{H|Arc Warden}} within the {{A|Arc Warden|Magnetic Field}} radius has {{Show|A|Arc Warden|Magnetic Field|value3}} evasion. Without any other evasion negating sources, all incoming attacks to hit {{H|Arc Warden}} are missed if the Self is within the radius.

;Example 2a
[[File:Evasion stacking.png|thumb|250px|Multiple evasion sources stack multiplicatively with diminishing returns with each other.]]
: '''Evasion sources stacks diminishingly.'''
: An enemy is attacking {{H|Phantom Assassin}} who has a {{I|Butterfly}} and {{cf|Level|4}} {{A|Phantom Assassin|Blur}}. What are the chances of incoming attacks hitting {{H|Phantom Assassin}}?

:: Evasion sources:
:: {{A|Phantom Assassin|Blur}}: {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:blur|{{#explode:{{#explode:{{Show|A|Phantom Assassin|Blur|value1}}|/|3}}|%}}/100}}}}
:: {{I|Butterfly}}: {{#expr:{{#var:btf f}}}}

:: Effective Evade Chance 
:: = 1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;(1 - Total Evasion)&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;(1 - Total Blind)&lt;/span&gt;
:: = 1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;[1 - (1 - {{#expr:{{#var:blur}}}}) × (1 - {{#expr:{{#var:btf f}}}})]&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;(1 - 0)&lt;/span&gt;
:: = {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:eg2a|(1-(1-{{#var:blur}})*(1-{{#var:btf f}}))}}}}

:: Final Hit Chance
:: = 1 - Effective Evade Chance 
:: = 1 - {{#expr:{{#var:eg2a}}}}
:: = {{#expr:1-{{#var:eg2a}}}}

:: Alternatively, Blur and Butterfly have the corresponding {{#expr:1-{{#var:blur}}}} and {{#expr:1-{{#var:btf f}}}} chance to hit. Then the combined chance to hit is their product, showing a multiplicative stacking:
:: Final Hit Chance
:: = {{#expr:1-{{#var:blur}}}} × {{#expr:1-{{#var:btf f}}}}
:: = {{#expr:(1-{{#var:blur}})*(1-{{#var:btf f}})}}

: {{H|Phantom Assassin}} in this example has {{#expr:(1-{{#var:eg2a}})*100}}% chance of getting hit by incoming attacks, because she has {{#expr:{{#var:eg2a}}*100}}% evasion.

;Example 2b
[[File:Blind stacking.png|thumb|250px|2 Blind sources stack additively with each other, there are no overlaps.]]
[[File:Evasion and blind stacking.png|thumb|250px|Blind sources are summed up, then it stacks multiplicatively with Evasion sources diminishingly as the unit's Effective Evade Chance.]]
: '''Blind sources stack additively of itself, then stacks diminishingly with evasion sources.'''
: An enemy attacking {{H|Phantom Assassin}} from the previous example is now affected by {{A|Radiance|Burn}} and {{cf|Level|4}} {{A|Riki|Smoke Screen}}. What are the chances of incoming attacks hitting {{H|Phantom Assassin}}?

:: {{H|Phantom Assassin}}'s Total Evasion: {{#expr:{{#var:eg2a}}}}

:: Blind sources:
:: {{A|Radiance|Burn}}: {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:burn|{{#explode:{{Show|A|Radiance|Burn|value4}}|%}}/100}}}}
:: {{A|Riki|Smoke Screen}}: {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:smoke|{{#explode:{{#explode:{{Show|A|Riki|Smoke Screen|value2}}|/|3}}|%}}/100}}}}

:: Effective Evade Chance
:: = [1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;(1 - Total Evasion)&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;(1 - Total Blind)&lt;/span&gt;]
:: = [1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;(1 - {{#expr:{{#var:eg2a}}}})&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;(1 - ({{#expr:{{#var:burn}}}} + {{#expr:{{#var:smoke}}}}))&lt;/span&gt;]
:: = [1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;{{#expr:1-{{#var:eg2a}}}}&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;{{#expr:1-({{#var:burn}}+{{#var:smoke}})}}&lt;/span&gt;]
:: = {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:eg2b|(1-(1-{{#var:blur}})*(1-{{#var:btf f}})*(1-({{#var:burn}}+{{#var:smoke}})))}}}}

:: Final Hit Chance
:: = 1 - Effective Evade Chance 
:: = 1 - {{#expr:{{#var:eg2b}}}}
:: = {{#expr:1-{{#var:eg2b}}}}

: Although {{H|Phantom Assassin}}'s total evasion did not change, the blind applied to the enemy increases {{H|Phantom Assassin}}'s effective evade chance to {{#expr:{{#var:eg2b}}*100 round2}}%. Therefore, {{H|Phantom Assassin}} has {{#expr:(1-{{#var:eg2b}})*100 round2}}% chance of getting hit by incoming attacks.

===Final Hit Chance=== 
;Stacking Evasion, Blind and Accuracy
Given a unit with an '''Effective Evade Chance''' and subjected to '''[[Evasion#Accuracy|Total Accuracy]]''' as defined in the above sections, the final chance to hit {{H|Phantom Assassin}} in the previous example can be derived to be:

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Final Hit Chance = &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt; + (1 - &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt;) × (1 - Effective Evade Chance)&lt;/span&gt;

An intuitive way to view this calculation — The attacking unit's attacks have a guaranteed chance to trigger [[Evasion#True Strike|True Strike]] based on the &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; value, whereas &lt;code&gt;'''(1 - &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt;)'''&lt;/code&gt; of the attacks that do not trigger True Strike will be subjected to the &lt;code&gt;'''Effective Evade Chance'''&lt;/code&gt;.

Or alternatively, it can be simplified as:

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Final Hit Chance = 1 - Effective Evade Chance × (1 - &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

This can also be interpreted as — Normally, &lt;code&gt;'''Effective Evade Chance'''&lt;/code&gt; of the attacks will miss. But due to accuracy, only &lt;code&gt;'''(1 - &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt;)'''&lt;/code&gt; of these would-be-missed attacks actually miss since attacks based on the &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; value will hit the target due to True Strike.

;Example 3
[[File:Total evasion and accuracy stacking.png|thumb|250px|Accuracy overwrites over Effective Evade Chance.]]
: The same enemy from the previous example is still affected by {{A|Radiance|Burn}} and {{cf|Level|4}} {{A|Riki|Smoke Screen}}.
: The enemy's {{U|Courier}} just delivered {{I|Monkey King Bar}} and continues to attack {{H|Phantom Assassin}}. What are the chances of incoming attacks hitting {{H|Phantom Assassin}}?

:: {{H|Phantom Assassin}}'s Total Evasion: {{#expr:{{#var:eg2a}}}}
:: Total Blind applied on the enemy: {{#expr:{{#var:burn}}+{{#var:smoke}}}}

:: Accuracy sources:
:: {{A|Monkey King Bar|Pierce}}: {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:mkb|{{#explode:{{Show|A|Monkey King Bar|Pierce|value1}}|%}}/100}}}}

:: Effective Evade Chance
:: = [1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;(1 - Total Evasion)&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;(1 - Total Blind)&lt;/span&gt;]
:: = [1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;(1 - {{#expr:{{#var:eg2a}}}})&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;(1 - ({{#expr:{{#var:burn}}}} + {{#expr:{{#var:smoke}}}}))&lt;/span&gt;]
:: = [1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;{{#expr:1-{{#var:eg2a}}}}&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;{{#expr:1-({{#var:burn}}+{{#var:smoke}})}}&lt;/span&gt;]
:: = {{#expr:{{#var:eg2b}}}}

:: Final Hit Chance
:: = &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt; + (1 - &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt;) × (1 - Effective Evade Chance)
:: = &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;{{#expr:{{#var:mkb}}}}&lt;/span&gt; + (1 - &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;{{#expr:{{#var:mkb}}}}&lt;/span&gt;) × [1 - &lt;span style="color:darkolivegreen;"&gt;(1 - {{#expr:{{#var:eg2a}}}})&lt;/span&gt; × &lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;(1 - ({{#expr:{{#var:burn}}}} + {{#expr:{{#var:smoke}}}}))&lt;/span&gt;]
:: = &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;{{#expr:{{#var:mkb}}}}&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;{{#expr:1-{{#var:mkb}}}}&lt;/span&gt; × {{#expr:1-{{#var:eg2b}}}}
:: = {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:eg3|({{#var:mkb}}+(1-{{#var:mkb}})*(1-{{#var:eg2b}}))}}}}

: The enemy's attacks have {{#expr:{{#var:eg3}}*100}}% chance to hit {{H|Phantom Assassin}}.
: In this example with {{I|Monkey King Bar}} equipped, {{#expr:{{#var:mkb}}*100}}% of those attacks is guaranteed to hit due to [[Evasion#True Strike|True Strike]]. The remaining {{#expr:(1-{{#var:mkb}})*100}}% of the attacks that do not have True Strike, have a {{#expr:(1-{{#var:eg2b}})*100}}% chance to hit Phantom Assassin.

: Or alternatively,

:: Final Hit Chance
:: = 1 - Effective Evade Chance × (1 - &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;Total Accuracy&lt;/span&gt;)
:: = 1 - {{#expr:{{#var:eg2b}}}} × (1 - &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;{{#expr:{{#var:mkb}}}}&lt;/span&gt;)
:: = 1 - {{#expr:{{#var:eg2b}}}} × &lt;span style="color:dodgerblue;"&gt;{{#expr:1-{{#var:mkb}}}}&lt;/span&gt;
:: = 1 - {{#expr:({{#var:eg2b}})*(1-{{#var:mkb}})}}
:: = {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:eg3 alt|(1-({{#var:eg2b}})*(1-{{#var:mkb}}))}}}}

: The enemy's attacks against {{H|Phantom Assassin}} normally have {{#expr:{{#var:eg2b}}*100}}% chance to miss.
: However, {{#expr:{{#var:mkb}}*100}}% of those {{#expr:{{#var:eg2b}}*100}}% attacks is guaranteed to hit due to [[Evasion#True Strike|True Strike]]. Therefore, only {{#expr:({{#var:eg2b}})*(1-{{#var:mkb}})*100}}% of the attacks will miss, resulting in a {{#expr:{{#var:eg3 alt}}*100}}% chance for attacks to hit Phantom Assassin.

{{Quotation|Sven|You look stunned.|sound=vo_sven_sven_ability_teleport_01.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Stun&lt;/dfn&gt; is a status effect that completely locks down affected units, disabling almost all of its capabilities.

==Mechanics==
[[File:Stun.png|thumb|250px|Stun overhead effects.&lt;br&gt;The yellow effect is used by [[bash]]-based abilities.]]
A stun on a unit is indicated by a special stunned animation (except for [[buildings]] and [[wards]]) and a whirling effect above their heads. It does not disable any passive abilities and do not affect any of the unit's [[attribute]]s.

&lt;section begin=Intro /&gt;Upon getting stunned, the unit stops its current order and stands still until the effect expires. While stunned, the unit cannot move, attack, cast abilities or use items.&lt;section end=Intro /&gt; 

If a unit gets stunned during their attack or cast animations the attack/cast get canceled. This means stuns fully interrupt [[channeling]] abilities. However, stuns do not make the unit forget their orders, including {{Key press|shiftqueue}} orders. Once the stun expires, the unit resumes with its previously interrupted order, if it was not given any other order while stunned.

While stunned, the unit can also be given any order normally, which it then executes as soon as the stun expires. 

If the order is not given using {{Key press|shiftqueue}}, it overrides the unit's previously canceled order. With shift-queue, the unit executes the newly given order after finishing the previously canceled order. When giving the unit multiple cast orders, they get automatically queued up. However, move and attack commands do not get queued and cancel the cast orders. This means when giving the stunned unit a cast order and then a move order without using shift-queue, it will only execute the move order. Vice versa, when the move order is given first, and then the cast order, only the cast order gets executed. In order to make the unit execute move or attack ''and'' cast orders after the stun expires, shift-queue must be used.

Stun is a different mechanic than [[root]], [[silence]], [[mute]] or [[disarm]]. Some active abilities can be cast while stunned, which are listed [[Disables#Disabling Orders|here]].

==Definition==
There are three types of stuns in the game, with each using a different modifier to stun the target(s). Stuns from the same group use the same modifier, therefore they refresh each others' duration based on when they affect the target and do not extend its stun duration.

{{Quotation|&lt;dfn&gt;Anti-Mage&lt;/dfn&gt;|Magic shall not prevail!|sound=vo_antimage_anti_attack_03.mp3}}
&lt;section begin=intro /&gt;
'''Debuff immunity''' is a modifier which stops most effects of debuffs' effects on a unit without dispelling the debuffs and without preventing debuffs from being placed on the unit. It also grants resistance against magical damage and immunity against pure and reflected damage, as well as protecting against mana loss.&lt;section end=intro /&gt;

==Mechanics==
[[File:Black King Bar Avatar.png|thumb|200px|Visage under the effect of {{I|Black King Bar}}]]
===Debuffs===
&lt;section begin=mechanics /&gt;Debuff immunity is a status effect. Most debuffs in the game first check whether or not the unit has the debuff immunity status. If the status is present, the debuff's effects cease temporarily, until the unit is no longer debuff immune. However, some debuffs (commonly those placed by ultimate abilities) pierce debuff immunity, meaning their effects carry on normally.

Usually, a debuff either fully pierces debuff immunity, or it is fully blocked. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. Whether or not a debuff pierces debuff immunity is noted down in the description boxes of each ability, right below the ability name. A compiled list can be found in the [[Debuff Immunity/Interactions|interactions]] tab.&lt;section end=mechanics /&gt;

Note that debuff immunity protects the unit from negative effects of debuffs. If a debuff has positive effects, it may apply them still, like {{A|Lone Druid|Savage Roar}} increasing movement speed. Furthermore, if a debuff has functional effects that only use the target as a source of origin, their effects continue (e.g. {{A|Disruptor|Thunder Strike}} continues striking, {{A|Dark Seer|Ion Shell}} continues to deal damage around the unit). Debuffs that have triggers can still have their effects triggered, like {{A|Silencer|Last Word}}, {{A|Brewmaster|Cinder Brew}}, and {{A|Orchid Malevolence|Soul Burn}}), the triggered effect is then still subjected to debuff immunity. Debuffs that apply buffs or debuffs on other units can still do so (e.g. {{A|Chen|Penitence}} still grants attacking enemies attack speed).

The following status effects are prevented by debuff immunity:
* [[Stun]]/[[Sleep]]
* [[Silence]]/[[Mute]]/[[Break]]
* [[Disarm]]/[[Blind]]
* [[Cyclone]], the unit stays on the ground
* [[Hex]], the unit's model does not change
* [[Forced Movement]], the movement gets immediately interrupted in most cases
* [[Fear (Game Mechanic)|Fear]]/[[Taunt]]
* [[Root]]/[[Leash]]
* [[Ethereal]]/[[Attack immunity]]
* [[Slow]]s
* General stats reductions
** [[movement Speed]]/[[Turn Rate]]
** [[Attack Speed]]/[[Projectile Speed]]
** [[Attack Damage]]/[[Spell Damage]]
** [[Magic Resistance]]/[[Status Resistance]]/[[Armor]]
** [[Attack Range]]/[[Cast Range]]
** [[Attack Animation]]/[[Cast Animation]]
** [[Strength]]/[[Agility]]/[[Intelligence]]
** [[Health]]/[[Health Regen]]/[[Heal]]
** [[Mana]]/[[Mana Regen]]/[[Mana Restore]]
** [[Lifesteal]]/[[Spell Lifesteal]]
** [[vision]]

===Damage===
{{Main|Damage types|l1=Damage Types}}
{{#lst:Damage types|debuff immunity}}

===Mana===
Debuff immunity also prevents abilities from draining, burning, or otherwise removing the unit's mana pool, so that only ability costs can reduce their mana, unless the ability pierces debuff immunity.

===True Sight and Vision===
With the exception of {{A|Nature's Prophet|Curse of the Oldgrowth}}, debuff immunity does not prevent abilities from revealing the unit with [[True Sight]], [[shared vision]], or from [[Expose|exposing]], even if the applying ability does not pierce debuff immunity.

===Dispel===
{{Main|Dispel}}
Debuff immunity does not dispel any debuffs upon gaining it, although most abilities which provide debuff immunity independently apply a form of [[dispel]] as part of the ability.

==Sources==
The following abilities grant debuff immunity and [[magic resistance]] bonus.

{{Quotation|Dark Seer|Speed is the heart of battle.|sound=vo_antimage_anti_resist_01.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Magic Resistance&lt;/dfn&gt; is a stat that reduces (or increases, if negative) a percentage of [[magical]] damage a unit takes from spells and magic attacks. Every unit is capable of gaining or losing magic resistance, and most units start with a small amount of base magic resistance. A hero's magic resistance can be passively increased with {{Symbol|Talent}} [[talents]], certain items, and some abilities. The magic resistance of any unit can also be temporarily increased or reduced with some abilities.

For illusions, all [[Magic Resistance#Modifying Magic Resistance|Magic Resistance Modifiying]] sources will be set to 0, since illusion do not benefit form magic resistance bonus.

The magical [[Damage Manipulation|damage multiplier]] is applied to all incoming magical damage sources to calculate the total magic damage received, after being reduced by [[damage barrier]] sources.

===Equations===
	 
The total magic resistance displayed on the [[HUD]] and the incoming [[magical]] damage multiplier can be defined as:
		 
{{Symbol|Magic Resistance|size=20px}} &lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Magic Resistance = 1 - Magical Damage Multiplier&lt;/span&gt;
	 	 
&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Magical Damage Multipler = [1 - [[Base Magic Resistance Negation|Negation Multiplier]] × ([[Base Magic Resistance|{{G|magic resistance}}]] + {{G|bonus magic resistance}} × {{Symbol|Intelligence|size=20px}})] × &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(1 - [[Magic Resistance#Modifying Magic Resistance|Magic Resistance Modifiers]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; )&lt;/span&gt;

===Actual Magic Damage Received===
The total or actual magic damage dealt is equal to how much [[health]] a target immediately loses as a direct result. The incoming damage received is calculated by the following factors, listed in the order of their applications:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{Treelist}}
* Actual Magical Damage Received
** Total [[Magical]] Damage
** - Magic [[Damage Block]]
** × Magic Resistance Multiplier
** - Magic [[Damage Barrier]]
** × Other generic incoming [[damage manipulation]] Sources
{{Treelist/end}}


In equation form: 

:: Actual Magical Damage Received = [ (Total [[Magical]] Damage - Magic [[Damage Block]]) × Magic Resistance Multiplier - Magic [[Damage Barrier]]] × Other generic incoming [[damage manipulation]] Sources

The '''Total [[Magical]] Damage''' can be amplified by the damage dealer's generic outgoing damage manipulation (e.g. [[spell amplification]]) before other calculations are performed. 

===Damage Block===

===Spell Immunity===
[[File:Spell Immunity icon.png|thumb|100px|Default buff icon&lt;br&gt;&lt;ab&gt;ui_ui_general_deny.mp3&lt;/ab&gt; Error sound.]]
{{Main|Spell Immunity#Mechanics|l1=Spell Immunity}}
{{#lst:Spell Immunity|intro}} A unit having 100% magic resistance neither equals being [[spell immune]] nor [[debuff immune]]. Therefore, all three of these mechanics are separate and different mechanics.

The biggest difference with Magic Resistance is that Spell Immune units do not interact with [[spell damage]] at all, while magic resistance reduces incoming [[magical]] damage from abilities.

Spell immunity usually are granted to some units as an extra layer of protection, usually on [[ward]]-type units, or in combination with [[invulnerability]].

==Base Magic Resistance==
'''Base magic resistance''' consists of one fixed value set for each unit individually, and it can be a negative number.

===Heroes===

===Summons===
{{Grouped attribute table|unit|magic_resistance|extraConditions=[[extradata_type::Creep-Hero]]|value heading=Magic Resistance}}

===Base Magic Resistance Negation===
Some abilities negate or ignore a unit's base magic resistance by removing a percentage of the base magic resistance on the target. This magic resistance negation only affects the base magic resistance value of units, other magic resistance bonus sources are not affected.

{{A|Elder Titan|Natural Order}} (and {{U|Astral Spirit}}'s {{A|Astral Spirit|Natural Order}}) interact with magic resistance differently. Instead of stacking multiplicatively with other sources of magic resistance, it acts as a multiplier for the base magic resistance. These two abilities are currently the only two sources of base magic resistance negation, and it is defined as

This means, for heroes with {{#expr:{{G|magic resistance}}*100}}% base magic resistance, {{A|Elder Titan|Natural Order}} applies a base magic resistance negation multiplier of {{calc|(1-v1)|v1={{Show|A|Elder Titan|Natural Order|value3}}}}, reducing the base magic resistance down to {{calc|{{G|magic resistance}}*(1-v1)|v1={{Show|A|Elder Titan|Natural Order|value3}}|%}}.

===Illusions Negation===
{{Main|Illusions}}
{{Mechanics wrapper|Illusions|Illusions

| notes = * Bonus magic resistance negation only affects the bonus magic resistance value of illusions, their base magic resistance is unaffected and still can be manipulated by other base magic resistance negation sources normally.
}}

==Stacking==
Each source of magic resistance acts as a incoming magic damage multiplier that work independently from each other. 
* For example, source that "increase magic resistance by 30%" or simply states "+30% Magic resistance" means that it acts as a &lt;code&gt;1 - 0.3 = 0.7&lt;/code&gt; incoming magic damage multiplier.
* They work independently from each other, meaning apply multiple magic resistance effects is equivalent to apply their corresponding magic damage multiplier in a multiplicative manner. This is similar to how [[evasion]] effects stack.
** A unit that has a +30% Magic resistance and another +40% Magic resistance means that it has a &lt;code&gt; 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42&lt;/code&gt; incoming magic damage multiplier. It will only take 42 damage when a 100 magic damage instance is dealt to it.
** Activating {{I|Black King Bar}} will reduce the magic damage a hero is taking by half, regardless of how much magic resistance it has.
** In other direction, a unit that has a -40% Magic resistance and another -60% Magic resistance means that it has a &lt;code&gt; 1.4 * 1.6 = 2.24&lt;/code&gt; incoming magic damage multiplier.
&lt;br&gt;
Because of this, combination of multiple magic resistance sources that are individually less than 100% is also effectively less than 100%.
* {{A|Oracle|Fate's Edict}} grants 100% magic resistance, which acts as a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; incoming magic damage multiplier. When it stacks with other magic resistance sources, the final incoming magic damage multiplier is always 0 (due to multiplication with 0). Thus, the affected unit will always take 0 magic damage, no matter what other source of negative magic resistance it has.
&lt;br&gt;
The magic resistance displayed in [[HUD]] is calculated from the final multiplier, after all magic resistance effects is accounted for.
* A unit with a &lt;code&gt;2.24&lt;/code&gt; incoming magic damage multiplier will be displayed as having -124% magic resistance.
&lt;br&gt;
The total magic resistance displayed on the [[HUD]] and the incoming [[magical]] damage multiplier can be defined as:

{{Symbol|Magic Resistance|size=20px}} &lt;code&gt;Total Magic Resistance = 1 - Final Magic Damage Multiplier&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Final Magic Damage Multiplier = &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(Magic Damage Multiplier&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; )&lt;/code&gt;

:: For base magic resistance, &lt;code&gt;Magic Damage Multiplier&lt;sub&gt;Base&lt;/sub&gt; = [1 - [[Base Magic Resistance Negation|Negation Multiplier]] × ([[Base Magic Resistance|{{G|magic resistance}}]] + {{G|bonus magic resistance}} × {{Symbol|Intelligence|size=20px}})]&lt;/code&gt;

:: For other magic resistance sources, &lt;code&gt;Magic Damage Multiplier&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 - Magic Resistance&lt;/code&gt;

In full equation,

&lt;code&gt;Total Magic Resistance = 1 - [1 - [[Base Magic Resistance Negation|Negation Multiplier]] × ([[Base Magic Resistance|{{G|magic resistance}}]] + {{G|bonus magic resistance}} × {{Symbol|Intelligence|size=20px}})] × &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(1 - [[Magic Resistance#Modifying Magic Resistance|Magic Resistance Modifiers]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; )&lt;/code&gt;

;Example 1:
: '''Magic Resistance Bonus and Magical Damage Multiplier'''
: {{H|Anti-Mage}} with level 4 {{A|Anti-Mage|Counterspell}} and has a {{I|Mage Slayer}} equipped. Without factoring in the base magic resistance increase by {{Attribute ID|intelligence}}, what is his current magic resistance?
:: Base hero magic resistance: {{G|magic resistance}}
:: Bonus magic resistance: {{A|Anti-Mage|Counterspell}}: {{#vardefineecho:counterspell|{{#expr:{{#explode:{{Show|A|Anti-Mage|Counterspell|type1 value1}}/|%/|3}}/100}}}}, {{I|Mage Slayer}}: {{#expr:{{Show|I|Mage Slayer|bonus magic resistance}}/100}}

:: Final Magic Damage Multiplier
:: = {{#vardefineecho:am1|(1 - {{G|magic resistance}}) * (1 - {{#var:counterspell}}) * (1 - {{#expr:{{Show|I|Mage Slayer|bonus magic resistance}}/100}})}}
:: = {{#expr:{{#var:am1}}}}

: All incoming [[magical]] damage dealt to {{H|Anti-Mage}} will now be multiplied by {{#expr:({{#var:am1}}) round2}}. His current total {{Symbol|Magic Resistance}} magic resistance in this example is 1 - {{#expr:{{#var:am1}}}} = {{#expr:(1 - {{#var:am1}})*100 round2}}%.

;Example 2:
: '''Magic Resistance Reduction and Magical Damage Multiplier'''
: {{H|Marci}} is now affected by two magic resistance reduction sources, level 4 {{A|Skywrath Mage|Ancient Seal}}, a level 4 {{A|Pugna|Decrepify}} and {{A|Leshrac|Nihilism}}.
: Without factoring in the base magic resistance increase by {{Attribute ID|intelligence}}, what is her current magic resistance?
:: Base hero magic resistance: {{G|magic resistance}}
:: Magic resistance reduction: {{A|Skywrath Mage|Ancient Seal}}: -{{#vardefineecho:seal|{{#expr:{{#explode:{{Show|A|Skywrath Mage|Ancient Seal|value2}}/|%/|3}}/100}}}}, {{A|Pugna|Decrepify}}: -{{#vardefineecho:decrep|{{#expr:{{#explode:{{Show|A|Pugna|Decrepify|value2}}/|%/|3}}/100}}}}, {{A|Leshrac|Nihilism}} -{{#expr:{{#explode:{{Show|A|Leshrac|Nihilism|value2}}|%}}/100}}

:: Final Magic Damage Multiplier
:: = (1 - {{G|magic resistance}}) * (1 - &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;-{{#var:seal}}&lt;/span&gt;) * (1 - &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;-{{#var:decrep}}&lt;/span&gt;)
:: = &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;{{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:marci3|(1 - {{G|magic resistance}}) * (1 + {{#var:seal}}) * (1 + {{#var:decrep}})}}}}&lt;/span&gt;

: All incoming [[magical]] damage dealt to {{H|Marci}} will now be multiplied by &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;{{#expr:{{#var:marci3}} round2}}&lt;/span&gt;. Her current total {{Symbol|Magic Resistance}} magic resistance in this example is 1 - &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;{{#expr:{{#var:marci3}} round2}}&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;{{#expr:(1 - {{#var:marci3}})*100}}%&lt;/span&gt;.
: The [[ethereal]] magic resistance reduction is not factored into the calculations because {{A|Pugna|Decrepify}} has a higher magic resistance reduction value than {{A|Leshrac|Nihilism}}.

==Effective Health==
The total amount of magic damage a unit can take due to magic resistance is known as Effective HP (or EHP). Despite each source of magic resistance increasing the magic resistance value less the higher it is and making them seem less effective, each source increases the unit's effective HP against magic damage by their base value. 

A unit with 0% magic resistance has 100% effective HP against magical damage, which means magical damage equaling 100% of its health is required to kill it. All heroes have {{#expr:{{G|magic resistance}}*100}}% magic resistance by default, making their effective HP against magical damage {{#expr:1/(1-{{G|magic resistance}})*100 round2}}%.

| {{#expr:1000/0.5 round0}}
| {{#expr:1000/0.25 round0}}
| &lt;big&gt;∞&lt;/big&gt;
|}

This definition of EHP assumes all damage taken is magic damage. EHP against [[Damage types#Physical|physical damage]] (e.g. basic hero attacks etc.) is modified by [[Armor#Effective HP|armor]].

Effective HP against magical damage is defined as 

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;EHP = Current&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt; / Final Magic Damage Multiplier&lt;/span&gt;

;Example 1
: {{H|Marci}} is Level 6 and has a {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:marcihp|trunc({{G|health}}+({{Show|H|Marci|strength}}+{{Show|H|Marci|strength growth}}*6)*{{G|bonus health}})}}}} [[health]], what is her EHP against [[magical]] damage?
:: Base magic resistance: {{#expr:{{#vardefineecho:marcimr|({{G|magic resistance}}+({{Show|H|Marci|intelligence}}+{{Show|H|Marci|intelligence growth}}*6)*{{G|bonus magic resistance}})}}}}

:: EHP&lt;sub&gt;magic&lt;/sub&gt;
:: = {{#expr:{{#var:marcihp}}}} / {{#expr:1-{{#var:marcimr}}}}
:: = {{#expr:({{#var:marcihp}})/(1-{{#var:marcimr}}) round2}}

: {{H|Marci}} has {{#expr:({{#var:marcihp}})/(1-{{#var:marcimr}}) round2}} EHP against magical damage in this example.

;Example 2
: {{H|Marci}} from Example 1 now is affected by two magic resistance reduction sources, a level 4 {{A|Skywrath Mage|Ancient Seal}} and level 4 {{A|Pugna|Decrepify}}. What is her EHP against magical damage now?
:: Health: {{#expr:{{#var:marcihp}}}}
:: Base magic resistance: {{#expr:({{#var:marcimr}})}}
:: Magic resistance reduction: {{A|Skywrath Mage|Ancient Seal}}: -{{#var:seal}}, {{A|Pugna|Decrepify}}: -{{#var:decrep}}

:: Final Magic Damage Multiplier
:: = (1 - {{#expr:{{#var:marcimr}}}}) * (1 - &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;-{{#var:seal}}&lt;/span&gt;) * (1 - &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;-{{#var:decrep}}&lt;/span&gt;)
:: = {{#expr:((1 - {{#var:marcimr}}) * (1 + {{#var:seal}}) * (1 + {{#var:decrep}}))}}

:: EHP&lt;sub&gt;magic&lt;/sub&gt;
:: = {{#expr:{{#var:marcihp}}}} / {{#expr:(1 - {{#var:marcimr}}) * (1 + {{#var:seal}}) * (1 + {{#var:decrep}})}}
:: = {{#vardefineecho:marcihp2|{{#expr:{{#var:marcihp}}/((1 - {{#var:marcimr}}) * (1 + {{#var:seal}}) * (1 + {{#var:decrep}})) round0}}}}

: {{H|Marci}} has {{#var:marcihp2}} EHP against magical damage in this example.

{{Quotation|Lion|Not feeling yourself?|sound=vo lion lion ability voodoo 10.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Hex&lt;/dfn&gt; (also referred to as ''Sheep'', ''Voodoo'', or ''Polymorph'') is a status effect which turns the affected unit into a harmless critter, disabling many of its fighting capabilities.

==Mechanics== 
[[File:Dota 2 Hex preview.gif|200px|thumb|Hexed Windranger, {{tooltip|collision size|orange circle}} stays unchanged, but the {{tooltip|selection boxes|red and blue frames}} change based on the Hex model.]]
&lt;section begin=Intro /&gt;All sources of hex instantly destroy [[illusions]] except strong illusions. Hexed heroes are still treated as heroes by abilities.&lt;section end=Intro /&gt;

Hex applies multiple disables on the target – [[silence]], [[mute]] and [[disarm]], rendering it unable to attack, cast abilities and use active item abilities. Since it applies a regular silence, abilities {{Key special|toggled/On}} are not {{Key special|toggled/Off}}, and already ongoing abilities are not stopped, except for [[channeling]] abilities. It does not [[dispel]] any status effect either.

However, it does not apply [[break]] (unless stated), thus all its passive abilities still work. It neither affects the target's [[armor]], nor its [[magic resistance]] or any other passive effects it currently has.

Though hexes transform the target into critters, this has only a visual aspect. The unit keeps all its properties, including [[collision size]]. However, its hit box and selection box changes.

Hex state can be removed by strong [[dispel]]s.

===Set Movement Speed===
{{Main|Movement speed#Set Movement Speed|l1=Movement Speed}}
&lt;section begin=Mechanics /&gt;Besides disabling, hex also directly sets the target's movement speed to a fixed value for the duration. The units are still fully affected by flat and percentage-based movement speed changes. Other movement speed notes fully apply.&lt;section end=Mechanics /&gt;

;Example 1:
{{H|Sand King}} has a base movement speed of {{Show|H|Sand King|movement speed}}. What is his movement speed if he is affected by {{H|Shadow Shaman}}'s {{A|Shadow Shaman|Hex}}?

: {{H|Sand King}}'s base movement speed will be set to {{Show|A|Shadow Shaman|Hex|value2}} for the duration.

&lt;section begin=intro /&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;Attack modifiers&lt;/dfn&gt; are modifiers which apply an effect to a unit's basic attacks. These effects can widely vary, from healing, to damaging or even disabling effects. Most of these modifiers have their own rules.&lt;section end=intro /&gt; For example, some modifiers may not stack with others, some may fully stack, some may be for {{Symbol|Melee}} melee units only and others for {{Symbol|Ranged}} ranged or both for some abilities. Attack modifiers can be active, in which case they require to be used manually, though most have an {{Key special|Autocast}} option, but they also can be passive, proccing, or having a chance to proc on each attack.

__TOC__
==Mechanics==
There is no set rule of how attack modifiers stack, most different types of attack modifiers stack with each other, whereas for the same type, it depends on the mechanics of the modifier itself. Note that most attack modifiers' description are only a general outline and different abilities may have specific additional rules or exceptions hard-coded.

Besides the common attack modifiers listed below, many heroes, units and items have attack modifiers which are unique to them, meaning they can be only found on those units or items. To correctly understand and predict interactions between these various mechanics, [[Attack modifier#On-hit Effects|on-hit effects]] have a different definition from attack modifiers.

===Definitions===
====Attack Modifiers====
Attack modifiers are applied to an attack at its inception. In some cases this is visually apparent on the attack projectile for {{Symbol|Ranged}} ranged heroes (e.g. {{A|Desolator|Corruption}} or {{A|Eye of Skadi|Cold Attack}} projectile), but not all attack modifiers have visual effects. As these modifications are calculated at the start of the attack, changes during the airborne time of an attack projectile (i.e. while picking up an item) will generally not affect these attacks that were launched earlier.

Therefore, attack modifiers are not applied if the attack is [[miss]]ed. Since the attack modifier is carried on the attack, if the attack fails, the modifier fails as well.

Multishot abilities that apply modifiers (e.g. {{Symbol|Aghanim}} {{A|Drow Ranger|Marksmanship}} and {{Symbol|Talent}} {{A|Medusa|Split Shot}}) will generally apply all attack modifiers, but generally not on-hit effects. This is because most on-hit effects are specified to happen only on the "first" or "next" attack, and only the attack landing on the primary target will meet this condition. The other attacks will check for on-hit effects, but as separate instances.

====On-hit Effects====
{{Main|Attack modifier#On-hit Effects Sources|l1=On-hit Effects Sources}}
On-hit effects are only applied at the time the attack arrives at its target. Since the projectile is airborne and the effect has not been applied and only applies on-hit, these on-hit effects does not have a visual effect. Conversely, value changes during the projectile airborne time can influence on-hit effects — In fact, the on-hit effect is not even tied to any particular attack, rather it is tied to an ability or item. The effect have an opportunity to perform actions before [[evasion]], but it may still be coded to take evasion into account. 

For example, the attack breaking out of {{A|Silver Edge|Shadow Walk}} invisibility that [[Break|disables passive abilities]] cannot miss; while {{A|Storm Spirit|Overload}} explicitly does nothing when the attack is evaded.

==Common Attack Modifiers==
Common attack modifiers are attack modifiers which are not unique abilities, but are seen commonly on many heroes and items. The only differences between them are their values and how they are activated or acquired, some being applied on each attack, others being chance-based.

Abilities which simply grant or reduce attack speed (e.g. {{A|Windranger|Focus Fire}} or {{A|Ursa|Overpower}}) or attack damage (e.g. {{A|Invoker|Alacrity}}) are not attack modifiers, as they directly enhance the attack, instead of granting a modification.

===Corruption===
{{Main|Armor#Armor Corruption Items|Armor#Armor Corruption|l1=Items|l2=Talent Sources}}
Armor Corruption is an attack modifier with an on-hit effect. It reduces the [[armor]] of the affected target. Successive attacks do not stack the debuff, but refresh the duration instead. The attacks first apply the armor reduction debuff, then their own damage. Works against [[ward]]s, [[buildings]], and allied units. Fully stacks with any other items or other sources of Armor Corruption.

===Critical Strike===
[[File:Crit.png|thumb|250px|{{H|Wraith King}} performing a critical strike.&lt;br&gt;The red number displays the resulting physical damage before reductions.]]
{{Main|Critical Strike}}
{{#lst:Critical Strike|main}} If an attack procs more than one source of critical strike, only the highest multiplier is applied.

===Active Attack Modifiers===
{{See also|Attack modifiers#Orb Walking|l1=Orb Walking (Trivia)}}
Active Attack Modifiers abilities are attack modifiers that must be actively used on each attack to apply their effects. They also can be set to {{Key special|Autocast}}, causing each attack to apply the effect if the hero can support their costs. Typically they use different [[attack range]] values if the [[cast range]] is different than the hero's attack range. 

If the ability is cast manually, using the designated {{Key press|Hotkey}}, the ability uses the cast range. When using {{Key special|Autocast}}, it uses the hero's attack range. The cast range of these abilities can be further increased by other attack range bonuses based on the hero's range type. However, it is ''not'' affected by cast range bonuses.

When set to {{Key special|Autocast}}, these abilities count as a regular attack; when used manually, they partly count as an ability cast. Therefore, unlike regular attacks, casting these attack modifiers manually, also known as '''Orb Walking''', neither draws aggro from [[lane creeps]] nor [[tower]]s. However, they do not count as abilities in any other scenario, meaning they cannot be used when attacking is restricted (i.e. [[disarm]]s) and do not proc nor trigger any [[on-cast effects]]. These active attack modifiers still use the hero's attack speed and the ability's projectile speed unless stated otherwise.

Active attack modifiers cannot be acquired by {{A|Rubick|Spell Steal}}.

==Trivia==
Unique Attack Modifiers (UAM, or formerly known as '''Orb Effects''') were attack modifiers that could not be used simultaneously with each other — one attack modifier always took priority, and multiple of them do not stack.

Unique attack modifiers did work simultaneously with other non-unique attack modifiers, with the following stacking priority:
* 1st - [[Attack modifiers#Active Attack Modifiers|Active attack modifiers]] that were manually cast.
* 2nd - Active attack modifiers set to {{Key special|Autocast}}.
* 3rd - Item-based unique attack modifiers.

In [[Ability Draft]], the first drafted unique attack modifier ability always override later acquired ones. When obtaining multiple items with unique attack modifiers, only the one that has been continuously the longest in the inventory will proc or trigger the attack modifier.  For [[illusions]], it is prioritized by inventory slot in reading order.

When attacking units that were invalid targets for certain unique attack modifiers (such as [[spell immune]] units, [[buildings]] etc.) with an attack modifier set to {{Key special|Autocast}}, other unique attack modifiers that the target was vulnerable to would be used, even if they were lower in priority. 

For example, [[spell immune]] heroes are immune to {{A|Outworld Destroyer|Arcane Orb}}, but if the hero was carrying a {{I|Morbid Mask}}, it would proc instead. This did not apply to other non-autocastable unique attack modifiers (e.g. {{A|Anti-Mage|Mana Break}}) — they still followed the above priority order regardless of a target's spell immunity.

===Orb Walking===
{{Main|Attack modifiers#Active Attack Modifiers|l1=Active Attack Modifier Sources}}
In [[wikipedia:Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos|Warcraft III]], unique attack modifiers are called '''orb effects'''. This is due to the items which grant the attack modifiers commonly being orbs (e.g. {{I|Orb of Venom}}, Orb of Corruption etc.) and these orb effects do not stack with each other. 

The items being portrayed as orbs serves as a metaphor, as stacking real sphere-shaped objects is very difficult to do. Since DotA is a custom map on Warcraft III, it made use of the abilities of these orb items, and the term "orb" was used to describe that attack modifiers based on those items do not stack. Therefore, unique attack modifiers are referred to as '''Orb Effects''' in DotA, just like how they are in Warcraft III. 

The term was later changed to '''Unique Attack Modifiers''' in Dota2 while '''Orb Effects''' was dropped. However, many players which came from DotA still refer to these modifiers as orb effects. The term '''Orb Walking''' originates therefore from Warcraft III, describing the same technique as described in the [[Attack modifiers#Active Attack Modifiers|active attack modifier]] section above.

===Stutter Stepping===
{{Main|Attack animation#Orb Walking|l1=Orb Walking}}
This technique which originated from Starcraft and carried over to various [[wikipedia:Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBAs]], was commonly used together with the [[Attack modifier#Active Attack Modifiers|active attack modifier]] orb walking technique. 

{{#lst:Attack animation|orb intro}}

Due to this, orb walking and stutter stepping were very commonly used together, so commonly that it is just referred to as orb walking, even though it was orb walking and stutter stepping together. Even though stutter stepping can be done with regular attacks as well. The term stutter stepping became less known as a result. However, outside of Dota, the technique is still called as stutter stepping.

[[File:Shadow Wave icon.png|frame]]
{{Quotation|Treant Protector|Life becomes death becomes new life. As it should be.|sound=_vo_treant_treant_rare_01.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Health&lt;/dfn&gt; (also known as HP, which is short for health points) represents the life force of a unit. When a unit's current health reaches 0, it dies. Every hero has a base health pool of {{G|health}}&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt;. This value exists for all heroes and cannot be altered. This means that a hero's maximum health cannot drop below {{G|health}}&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Because each point of strength increases a hero's health by {{G|bonus health}}&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt;, a hero's health pool scales upwards with their {{Attribute ID|strength}} points. Similarly, because every hero has some measure of strength growth per level, all heroes gain more health as they continue to level up. A hero's base strength cannot drop below 1; however, it is possible to achieve 0 strength with the help of negative bonus strength.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{Treelist}}
* Total hero health can be defined as
** Base Health
*** + {{G|bonus health}} × {{Symbol|Strength}} (Base Strength + (Level - 1) × [[wikipedia:Floor and ceiling functions|⌊]]Strength Gain[[wikipedia:Floor and ceiling functions|⌋]] ± Bonus Strength)
*** ± Flat Bonus Health Values
** × % Bonus Current/Max Health Values

==Display==
[[File:health and mana.png|frame|Green bar shows Health. Right number is health regeneration.]]
The health of a unit is displayed in the game world. It also is displayed again in the [[HUD]] upon selecting a unit.

===HUD Health Bar===
[[File:Hud health bar comparison.png|frame|Default health bar compared to colorblind mode&lt;br&gt; In colorblind mode, all HUD health bars are turned blue.]]
Health of the selected unit is displayed in the HUD as a green bar at the bottom of the screen, or blue in colorblind mode. The left number at the center of the bar is the unit's current health points and the right number is its maximum health points. Though not displayed in the HUD, a unit's total health does use decimal numbers. The visible numbers in the HUD are always rounded up.

The [[health regeneration]] value is visible on health bars in the HUD of every unit. Though the HUD shows only one decimal for health regeneration, it uses more decimals. The value in the HUD is rounded up.
{{clr}}

===Over-head Health Bar===
[[File:HP Comparison.png|thumb|Pudge with six different amounts of health.]]
The health bar in the game world are displayed right above every unit's head. Unlike the health bar in the HUD, the bar's color change based on alliances. It is green when it is an allied unit and red when it is an enemy unit (including neutral creeps). For spectators, neutral creeps' health bar take an ocher color. In colorblind mode, allied and the own overhead healthbars are blue, and in {{Key press|Differentiate Ally Healthbars}} mode (in settings), allied overhead health bars are ocher, while the own health bar stays green.

There are 4 different types of health bars: Hero, creep-hero, building and creep health bars. Their differences lie in their color shade, size and other small differences. Heroes and creep-heroes have vertical lines in them which divide their health pool to make it easier to determine their exact amount of health. By default, their health bars display a thin line for every 250&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt; and a thick line for every 1000&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt;. Most of these health display options can be configured to personal preference by using the &lt;code&gt;dota_health_per_vertical_marker&lt;/code&gt; [[List of Console Commands|console command]].

==Modifying Health==
Some heroes, units ([[neutral creeps]] and [[summoned units]]) and items have abilities that can affect the current and maximum health pool of units.

===Healing===
Increasing a unit's current health is most commonly known as '''Healing'''. Healing cannot increase the unit's health beyond its maximum health pool. Spells may apply a burst of heal on a target, which restore an amount of health in an instance, or heal the target over time, where the amount is split up in multiple instances. The difference between a heal and regeneration is that a heal is independent from the regeneration ticks. Unlike regeneration, their heal intervals can vary. A heal is not reflected in the regeneration number on the health bar.

Besides [[lifesteal]] and [[spell lifesteal]], the following abilities heal units:

There are several other abilities that are able to increase a unit's current health, but these effects do not count as healing. This means, similar to how damage flagged as [[HP Removal]] does not react on on-damage effects, these abilities fully ignore abilities that react on healing, like {{A|Ancient Apparition|Ice Blast}}, {{A|Oracle|False Promise}} and {{A|Io|Tether}}.

===Min Health===
&lt;section begin=Min Health /&gt;[[File:Min health demo.gif|250px|thumbnail|{{H|Lina}} casting {{A|Lina|Laguna Blade}} on a low health {{H|Dazzle}} affected by {{A|Dazzle|Shallow Grave}} and {{I|Blade Mail}}.&lt;br&gt;Lina takes the full Laguna Blade damage.]]
'''Minimum Health''', also prevents a unit from dying like damage negation. However, instead of directly reducing or negating damage, this mechanic manipulates the health of the unit. The &lt;code&gt;MODIFIER_PROPERTY_MIN_HEALTH&lt;/code&gt; property prevents a unit's health from dropping below the value it is set to. It does not affect the damage itself, meaning [[on-damage effects]] still reacts on the full damage, and not how much damage was dealt with effectively, so they can be triggered normally.

Does not prevent [[instant kill]] sources (e.g. {{A|Axe|Culling Blade}}) in any way.

Min health sources have the following priority:

{{Symbol|Aghanim}} {{A|Wraith King|Reincarnation|text=Wraith Delay}} ➤ {{A|Dazzle|Shallow Grave}} / {{A|Troll Warlord|Battle Trance}}
{{clr}}

{{Footnote|2a|Requires {{I|Aghanim's Scepter}}.}}
{{Footnote|2b|Requires {{I|Aghanim's Shard}}.}}&lt;section end=Min Health /&gt;

===Damaging===
{{Main|Damage Types}}
Just like how there are ways to increase a unit's current health, there also are ways to do the opposite, reduce a unit's current health, with the use of damage. Unlike heals, there are multiple types of damage, which act differently based on the defenses of the unit, mainly [[armor]] and [[magic resistance]].

===Setting Health===
&lt;section begin=set health /&gt;Besides healing and damaging, a unit's health may also be directly altered by setting it to certain values. Health altered this way is neither registered as a heal, nor as damage, and therefore is ignored by anything that reacts to healing and damage. It can also never be lethal, and can never set the health beyond the unit's {{tooltip|max|Current / (Max)}} health. When casting the following abilities with lesser health than the health cost, the caster's goes down to 1&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[HP Removal]] is not the same as Setting Health. HP Removal is still damage, but flagged to bypasses several but not all on-damage effects, and can still be lethal.&lt;section end=set health /&gt;

===Maximum Health Affecting Abilities===
Besides {{Attribute ID|strength}} there are a few other ways to increase or alter a unit's maximum health. Usually, when increasing or reducing a unit's maximum health via other ways than strength, its current health percentage stays the same, so that no healing effect occurs.

The following abilities are able to alter a unit's maximum health pool (sources of strength are not listed):

{{SkillListHead|title=Max Health Altering Sources}}

===Items===
Many items grant their owners a health bonus, increasing their maximum health when equipped, either by increasing their strength, or by just giving them a flat bonus. In either case, the current health percentage stays the same.

The following items increase a unit's maximum health pool. The effects are limited to the item's owner, which must have the item equipped.

Items that provide health bonus by flat amount and strength: 
{{#lpdb:datapoint
| conditions = [[type::item_bonustraits]] AND [[extradata_bonus_health::!]] AND [[extradata_bonus_strength::!]] AND [[extradata_game::]]
| query = pagename, extradata

| starttemplate = Item bonus value table start{{!}}userparam=Flat-Rate &amp; Strength Health
| template = Item bonus value table el{{!}}health{{!}}strength{{!}}modifier2={{G|bonus health}}
| endtemplate = Item bonus value table end
| default = No items found!
| order = name ASC
}}

These items have a flat health bonus to the hero who has them equipped.
{{#lpdb:datapoint

| starttemplate = Item bonus value table start{{!}}userparam=Flat-Rate Health
| template = Item bonus value table el{{!}}health
| endtemplate = Item bonus value table end
| default = No items found!
| order = name ASC
}}

These items increase the hero's health through the strength they provide.

==Heal Manipulation==
{{Main|Restoration manipulation#Heal manipulation|l1=Restoration manipulation}}
Heal manipulation refers to any form of amplification and reduction applied to health restoration. Heal manipulations affect every ability listed under [[#healing|healing]].

===Health Freeze===
(should consider renaming it to Anti-Healing) for future use
{{#lst:Restoration manipulation|health_freeze}}

==On-heal Effects==
Similar to how some abilities react on a unit getting damaged, some abilities react on a unit getting healed, or on a unit regenerating health. Only health gain that is classified as a [[#Healing|heal]], and health regeneration trigger on-heal effects. Health gained in other means (e.g. getting [[#Setting health|health set]]) does not trigger it.

Besides heal amplifications, the following abilities react on healing and regeneration
{{SkillListHead}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Io
| name = Tether
| notes = Heals the tethered ally by a percentage of heals and regeneration the caster receives, whenever the caster gets healed or regenerates health.

[[File:Chakra Magic icon.png|frame|&lt;ab&gt;ui_deny_mana.mp3&lt;/ab&gt; Out of mana!]]
{{Quotation|Keeper of the Light|It's a new age of magic!|sound=vo_keeper_of_the_light_keep_chakramagic_01.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Mana&lt;/dfn&gt; (also known as MP, which is short for mana points) represents the magic power of a unit. It is used as a cost for the majority of active and even some passive abilities. Every hero has a base mana pool of {{G|mana}}&lt;sub&gt;MP&lt;/sub&gt;, while most non-hero units only have a set mana pool if they have abilities which require mana, with a few exceptions. These values cannot be altered. This means that a hero's maximum mana cannot drop below {{G|mana}}&lt;sub&gt;MP&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Because each point of intelligence increases a hero's mana by {{G|bonus mana}}&lt;sub&gt;MP&lt;/sub&gt;, a hero's mana pool scales upwards with their {{Attribute ID|intelligence}} points. Similarly, because every hero has some measure of intelligence growth per level, all heroes gain more and more mana as they continue to level up. A hero's base intelligence cannot drop below 1; however, it is possible to achieve 0 intelligence with the help of negative bonus intelligence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{Treelist}}
* Total hero mana can be defined as
** Base Mana
*** + ({{G|bonus mana}} × {{Attribute ID|Intelligence}})
*** ± Flat Bonus Mana Values
** × % Bonus Current/Max Mana Values
{{Treelist/end}}

==Display==
[[File:health and mana.png|frame|Blue bar shows mana. Right number is mana regeneration.]]
The mana of a unit is displayed in the [[HUD]]. For some units, it also may be displayed in the game world.

===HUD Mana bar===
[[File:Heroes health bar.png|thumb|The mana bars of enemy heroes and creep-heroes are not visible above their head.]]
Mana of the selected unit is displayed in the HUD as a blue bar at the bottom of the screen. The left number at the center of the bar is the unit's current mana points and the right number is its maximum mana points. Though not displayed in the HUD, a unit's total mana does use decimal numbers. The visible numbers in the HUD are always rounded up.

The mana regeneration value is visible on mana bars in the HUD of every unit. Though the HUD shows only one decimal for mana regeneration, it uses more decimals. The value in the HUD is rounded up. 

===Over-head Mana bar===  
The mana bar of heroes and creep-heroes are displayed right above their heads, below their health bar. Even when a creep-hero has no mana pool, a mana bar is still drawn below their health bar above them. Other units do not have an overhead mana bar.

There are no different types of mana bars. They do not have lines like the health bars and do not differ from each other in any way.
{{clr}}

==Modifying Mana==
Some heroes, units ([[neutral creeps]] and [[summoned units]]) and [[items]] have abilities that can affect the current and maximum mana pool of units.

===Restoring Mana===
Just like healing [[health]], a unit's current mana can be increased by many abilities, mostly referred to as ''restoring mana''.

Restoring mana cannot increase the unit's mana beyond its maximum mana pool. Certain abilities may restore mana in a burst on a target, restoring an amount of mana in an instance, or restore mana over time, where the amount is split up in multiple instances. The difference between restoring mana and regenerating mana is that restoring is independent from the regeneration ticks. Unlike regeneration, the restore intervals can vary. Restoring mana is not reflected in the regeneration number on the mana bar.

===Removing Mana===
Most active and some passive abilities need mana in order to be used. This includes item abilities. The mana cost of such are displayed at the bottom left corner of the ability icon in the HUD, and once more inside the ability description in the bottom left corner. Most abilities have a fixed amount of mana cost, but some are dynamic (e.g. based on mana pool, or costing mana over time).

Besides using mana, there are also ways to offensively make units lose mana unvoluntarily. This act may be referred to as ''burning'' if it causes damage based on mana removed, ''draining'' if the mana is stolen and transferred to another unit, or ''removed'' if the mana is simply removed without other effects.

===Setting Mana===
Besides restoring and removing mana, a unit's mana may also be directly altered by setting it to certain values. Mana altered this way is neither registered as a mana restorement, nor as mana removal, and therefore is ignored by anything that reacts on restored or removed mana. It can never set the mana beyond the unit's maximum mana.

===Maximum Mana Affecting Abilities===
Besides {{Attribute ID|intelligence}} and raw bonuses from items, there are only very few abilities which can alter a unit's maximum mana.

This list does not include intelligence affecting sources.
{{SkillListHead|title=Max Mana Altering Sources}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Eye of the Vizier

| value2 = {{Show|A|Soul Ring|Sacrifice|value3}}
| notes = If the added mana would exceed the user's current mana pool, its maximum mana pool is temporarily increased by the exceeding amount.
}}
{{SkillListTail}}

===Items===
Many items grant their owners a mana bonus, increasing their maximum mana when equipped, either by increasing their intelligence, or by just giving them a flat bonus. In either case, the current mana percentage stays the same.

The following items increase a unit's maximum mana pool. The effects are limited to the item's owner, which must have the item equipped.

Items that provide mana bonus by flat amount and intelligence: 
{{#lpdb:datapoint
| conditions = [[type::item_bonustraits]] AND [[extradata_bonus_mana::!]] AND [[extradata_bonus_intelligence::!]] AND [[extradata_game::]]
| query = pagename, extradata
| limit = 5000
| starttemplate = Item bonus value table start{{!}}userparam=Flat-Rate &amp; Intelligence Mana
| template = Item bonus value table el{{!}}mana{{!}}intelligence{{!}}modifier2={{G|bonus mana}}
| endtemplate = Item bonus value table end
| default = No items found!
| order = name ASC
}}

These items have a flat mana bonus to the hero who has them equipped.
{{#lpdb:datapoint
| conditions = [[type::item_bonustraits]] AND [[extradata_bonus_mana::&gt;0]] AND [[extradata_bonus_intelligence::]] AND [[extradata_game::]]

| starttemplate = Item bonus value table start{{!}}userparam=Flat-Rate Mana
| template = Item bonus value table el{{!}}mana
| endtemplate = Item bonus value table end
| default = No items found!
| order = name ASC
}}


These items increase the hero's mana through the intelligence they provide.

}}

==Mana Restore Manipulation==
{{Main|Restoration manipulation#Mana Restore Manipulation|l1=Restoration Manipulation}}
Mana restore manipulation refers to any form of amplification and reduction applied to mana restoration. Mana restore manipulations affect every ability listed under [[Mana#Restoring Mana|mana restoring]].

{{SkillListHead|title=Mana Restore Manipulation Sources}}
{{#lst:Restoration manipulation|Mana Restore Manipulation}}
{{SkillListTail}}
{{Footnote|1|Requires {{Symbol|Talent}} [[talent]].}}
{{Footnote|2a|Requires {{I|Aghanim's Scepter}}.}}
{{Footnote|2b|Requires {{I|Aghanim's Shard}}.}}

==Mana Loss Manipulation==
Several abilities are able to reduce the amount of mana a unit loses. This includes the mana cost of abilities, and mana removed, burned or drained by abilities. Mana Loss Manipulation stacks multiplicatively.

Mana loss manipulation has no effect on mana regeneration, so if the regeneration should have a negative value, mana loss reduction does not affect it.

It does not affect mana changes caused by losing or gaining {{Attribute ID|intelligence}}. Current mana percentages are kept equal upon gaining or losing {{Attribute ID|intelligence}}, regardless of mana loss reductions. It also has no effect on [[Mana#Setting Mana|mana setting effects]].

When an ability has extra effects based on the mana loss, these extra effects are not affected by mana loss reduction. For example, &lt;section begin=manalosseffect /&gt;[[Mana Break]] abilities deal full damage, despite burning less mana and mana draining effects still restore the same amount, despite their targets losing less mana.&lt;section end=manalosseffect /&gt; However, mana loss reduction is applied before the ability is actually cast, causing for example, {{A|Pugna|Nether Ward}} to deal reduced damage.

}}

{{Talent bonus table|Mana Reduction|mana loss reduction}}

==On-restore Effects==
Similar to how some abilities react on a unit getting damaged, some abilities react on a unit getting mana restored, or on a unit regenerating mana. Only mana gain that is classified as a [[Mana#Mana restoring|mana restoring]], and mana regeneration trigger on-restore effects. Mana gained in other means (e.g. getting [[#Setting mana|mana set]]) does not trigger it.

Besides mana restore amplifications, the following abilities react on restoring and regeneration.
{{SkillListHead}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Io
| name = Tether
| notes = Restores the tethered ally's mana by a percentage of restorement and regeneration the caster receives, whenever the caster gets restored or regenerates mana.
}}

==Abilities Modified by Mana==
These abilities have effects that are based on maximum mana.

{{Footnote|2b|Requires {{I|Aghanim's Shard}}.}}
&lt;br&gt;
Besides [[illusions]], whose current health and mana depend on the current health and mana of the unit they are based on, the following abilities have effects that are based on current mana.

[[File:Jinada icon.png|frame]]
&lt;section begin=intro /&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;Attack damage&lt;/dfn&gt; ( &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ) is the amount of damage a unit is shown to deal with a regular attack. A unit's total attack damage is the sum of its [[Attack damage#Main Attack Damage|main attack damage]] (white) and [[Attack damage#Bonus Attack Damage|bonus attack damage]] (green).&lt;section end=intro /&gt; Attack damage is and can be modified by many different effects in the game, and ends up going through a number of steps in order to determine how much damage an attack actually deals as its overall or total attack damage.

__TOC__
==Total Attack Damage==
[[File:Basic_Stats_(for_Mechanics).png|frame|Properties of a level 1 {{H|Sniper}} with {{I|Blades of Attack}}: Sniper's base attack damage varies by 6; main attack damage is white, bonus attack damage green.]]
Calculating the total damage of an attack involves using many different multipliers and values. Total attack damage is synonymous with how much health a target immediately loses as a direct result of the attack. Some on-hit effects that are not affected by critical strike are still considered part of attack damage, and some are not.

===Total Attack Damage Sources===
{{Treelist}}
* Total Attack Damage can be defined as
** [[Attack Damage#Base Attack Damage|Base]] and [[Attack Damage#Main Attack Damage|Main]] Value

==Main Attack Damage==
{{Main|Attack Damage/Heroes|l1=Heroes' Main Attack Damage Table}}
Main attack damage is the damage value shown in white numbers on a hero's statistics consisting of the base attack damage with the damage granted by a hero's primary attribute on top. A hero's main attack damage can only be increased by raising its [[Attributes#Primary Attribute|primary attribute]], or by very few specific abilities.

Attribute points can be acquired by leveling up, or by using specific items, abilities, or {{Symbol|Talent}} [[talent]]s that grants bonus attributes.

Main Attack Damage is defined as

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Main Attack Damage = ([[Attack Damage#Base Attack Damage|Base Attack Damage]] + Σ [[Attributes#Primary Attribute|Primary Attribute]]) × &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(1 - Modifiers &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

==Base Attack Damage==
Base attack damage is the part of the main attack damage that stays the same throughout a game. It consists of two values, a minimum and maximum amount. Every time an attack is issued, a random value between the minimum and maximum is chosen to help decide the damage output. 

The most extreme hero example of this is {{H|Chaos Knight}}, with his base attack damage ranging between {{Show|H|Chaos Knight|attack damage min}} – {{Show|H|Chaos Knight|attack damage max}}, causing his damage output to be somewhat unpredictable. This range of {{#expr:{{Show|H|Chaos Knight|attack damage max}}-{{Show|H|Chaos Knight|attack damage min}}}} is always part of his attack calculations, no matter how many attributes or how much bonus attack damage he acquires.

{{Talent bonus table|Base Damage|base attack damage}}

==Bonus Attack Damage==
'''Bonus attack damage''' is the attack damage value shown in green numbers with a plus on the left, right after the white attack damage number on a unit's statistics. Whenever a [[Attack Damage#Bonus Attack Damage Source|bonus attack damage granting item or ability]] shows a &lt;code&gt;+Attack Damage&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. {{I|Blades of Attack}} &lt;code&gt;+{{Show|I|Blades of Attack|bonus attack damage}} Damage&lt;/code&gt;, it increases the bonus attack damage of the affected unit.

Probably the most important difference between main and bonus attack damage is that [[illusions]] only benefit from main attack damage, although their [[HUD]] still shows the bonus damage number just like on other heroes, to make them less obvious to the enemy. 

There are two types of bonus attack damage:
* '''[[Attack Damage#Flat Bonuses|Flat Bonuses]]''': Adds a flat number of damage to the unit's damage total (e.g. {{I|Phase Boots}} etc.).
* '''[[Attack Damage#Percentage Bonuses|Main Attack Damage Percentage Bonuses]]''': Adds an amount of bonus attack damage equal to a percentage of the affected unit's [[Attack Damage#Main Attack Damage|main attack damage]]  (e.g. {{I|Vladmir's Offering}}, {{A|Alpha Wolf|Packleader's Aura}} etc.). While bonus attack damage is usually positive values, it can also use a negative value to reduce a unit's net attack damage (e.g. {{A|Razor|Static Link}} etc.).


Bonus Attack Damage is defined as

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Bonus Attack Damage = ([[Attack Damage#Main Attack Damage|Main Attack Damage]] × &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;(1 + Bonus Value Modifiers &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) + Flat Bonus Values&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;section begin=attackclassintro /&gt;There are currently 3 different classes of attack damage types (also known as '''Attack Classes'') that manipulate the damage value of a unit's attack against certain other unit types. Each attack classes deal either reduced, increased, or unchanged damage against heroes, creeps (i.e. non-hero units), and [[buildings]], before all [[armor]] reduction values.&lt;section end=attackclassintro /&gt;

The attack classes are represented by 3 abilities visible in the unit's HUD. If a unit does not have any of these 3 abilities, their attacks deal 100% damage and are only altered by the target's armor and other damage manipulators.

==Instant Attacks==
&lt;section begin=instantatk /&gt;Instant Attacks are abilities that uses the hero's regular attack damage values as ability damage to the target unit(s) or area. Instant Attacks do not use the hero's [[attack animation]], are independent from [[attack speed]], and ignores the regular downtime between attacks. Certain abilities that deal instant attack damage are not affected by [[evasion]].&lt;section end=instantatk /&gt; If an instant attack is performed by a {{Symbol|Ranged}} Ranged hero, it still uses their regular attack projectile for the attack, unless it is set not to. 

If an instant attack occurs while already attacking an enemy normally, it does not interfere with the regular attacks. Instant Attacks do not interfere with any other actions of the hero either, meaning they neither interrupt movement, nor cancel ability casts nor stop [[channeling]] abilities.

Since instant attacks do not use attack animations and jump straight to the attack point, they cannot proc effects which react on the start of an attack (e.g. {{A|Enchantress|Untouchable}} or {{A|Legion Commander|Moment of Courage}}). However, they can proc effects which react on attack hit (e.g. {{A|Axe|Counter Helix}} or {{A|Centaur Warrunner|Retaliate}}), although there are some exceptions to this. 

Instant attacks may proc on-hit effects only when they are allowed to. An instant attack which is not allowed to proc [[attack modifier]]s is not allowed to proc on-hit effects either. [[Evasion]] and [[blind]] fully work against instant attacks. Just like regular attacks, most instant attacks also cause the attacking hero to get revealed under {{A|Smoke of Deceit|Disguise}} and/or when attacking from the [[Fog of War]] unless stated in their respective ability notes.

'''Ignore disarm?''' - Most instant attacks' rule for interaction with [[disarm]] is relatively intuitive: if the instant attack is generated outside of normal attack animation, it ignores disarm. If it is generated together with a normal attack animation (e.g. various multishot instant attacks), then the attack is trivially not generated due to the normal attack not being allowed. The few exceptions are highlighted in '''bold'''.

===Attack-based Projectiles===
Some abilities generate projectiles that are based on an attack, but are technically not an attack. These abilities' projectiles use the source's attack projectile, and deal damage based on the attacking unit's attack damage, and have their damage flagged as attack damage as well, but are not counted as attacks otherwise. Instead, they are treated like regular ability projectiles (like e.g. {{A|Vengeful Spirit|Magic Missile}}), and therefore cannot trigger attack modifier or on-hit effects, ignore evasion and blind, and do not reveal the attacking units through the [[Fog of War]]. This also means that these abilities continue to use projectiles even when their source is a melee hero.

They are affected by [[Attack Damage#Attack Classes|attack classes]] (even when dealing [[magical]] or [[pure]] damage). It is also not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions, but can be reduced with flat reductions (i.e. [[Damage Block]]).

[[File:Illusion abilityicon dota2 gameasset.png|thumbnail|Default buff icon&lt;br&gt;&lt;ab&gt;Illusion spawn.mp3&lt;/ab&gt; Spawn sound&lt;br&gt;&lt;ab&gt;Illusion death.mp3&lt;/ab&gt; Death sound]]
{{Quotation|Windranger|One of me ain't enough.|sound=Vo_windrunner_wind_illus_02.mp3}}

&lt;dfn&gt;Illusions&lt;/dfn&gt; are imperfect, weaker copies of heroes, created by abilities or items. They look like and are mostly treated like a hero, but are impaired, as they usually have incoming and outgoing damage penalties, dealing less damage and taking more damage than heroes. They are incapable of casting abilities or using active item abilities, and also have some passive abilities disabled. They also may not drop or pick up items or [[runes]]. Illusions yield a little gold and experience based on the hero's level. They do not soak up any [[Experience#Acquiring Experience|experience]] and [[gold]]. Illusions cannot level up, the gold from last hits they make goes to their owners, and do not interfere with kill streaks or counters.

Illusions can be created from an allied, enemy, or the own hero. The illusions copies its appearance, level, {{Attribute ID|all}}, attack values, defensive values (e.g. base [[armor]] and base [[magic resistance]]) and abilities on their current level. All items owned by the main hero are copied as well, including all their stats (although some effects of abilities and items are disabled for illusions).

All illusions deal {{#expr:{{G|illusion dmg v structure}}*100}}% less damage against [[buildings]], making them weaker in pushing. This reduction stacks multiplicatively with the outgoing damage reduction values most illusions have, and also multiplicatively with the damage reduction [[hero damage]] does against [[structure armor]] type. However, due to the fact that illusions are based on heroes, their damage scales together with the heroes, making them still a significant pushing tool, especially in later phases of a match.

All illusions are [[invulnerable]] for 0.1 seconds as they spawn, regardless of which ability that spawns or creates them. Illusions also always play the same spawn sound upon spawning, which are only audible to allies, and the same death sound upon dying in any way, including upon expiring.

==Visual Appearance==
[[File:Illusion comparison.png|thumb|Camouflaged illusions as they appear to allies and enemies.]]

Illusions are always visually distinguishable to their allies, with an extra texture layer on their model and their unit portrait, and a creep [[Health#Over-head health bar|health bar]]. Allied Illusions also have a duration indicator the left of their health bar.

For enemy illusions, this depends on the source ability. Some abilities create illusions that the enemy also sees as an illusion, with the extra texture layer and a creep health bar (but without the duration indicator), however, some other abilities create illusions that are camouflaged.

To the enemy, a camouflaged illusion looks identical to the hero they are based on. They do not show their illusion texture, and display the regular hero health bar with all its components (hero icon, player name, mana bar, other extra icons like the [[Battle Pass]] badges). Allies see them as illusions normally.

There are 7 different illusion textures.

===Magic Resistance Bonuses===
Some sources of magic resistance work with illusions and some do not. [[Magic resistance#Sources of magic resistance bonus|Magic resistance increasing]] abilities do not affect illusions, except for {{A|Oracle|Fate's Edict}} and magic resistance increasing {{Symbol|Talent}} [[talent]]s. However, in the [[HUD]], magic resistance is always displayed as if they were fully affected.

The following magic resistance sources affect illusions:
{{SkillListHead|title=Magic Resistance Sources Affecting Illusions}}

{{SkillListLite

{{SkillListTail}}
{{Footnote|1|Requires {{I|Aghanim's Scepter}}.}}
{{Footnote|2|Requires {{I|Aghanim's Shard}}.}}

===Bounty===
Illusions have a gold and experience bounty equal to two times their level. The gold bounty is granted to the player killing the illusion, while the experience is shared within the default experience area. However, the experience is only granted when the illusion is killed by a player. Expiring illusions, or illusions dying to lane creeps, towers, fountains or neutral creeps do not grant any experience.

Illusion bounty formula:
* {{cf|expr}} &lt;code&gt;{{G|illusion bounty level factor}} * Illusion&lt;sub&gt;LVL&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The following table shows their bounties on each level:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
! class="header" width="5%" | Level
{{#invoke:loop|i|1|30|&lt;nowiki&gt;
!! style="width:1.5em;" {{!}} {{#var:i}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
|-
! class="header" | Gold
{{#invoke:loop|i|1|30|&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{!!}} {{Gold|{{#expr:{{G|illusion bounty level factor}}*{{#var:i}}}}|color}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
|}


The following illusions grant a fixed {{Gold|{{G|illusion fixed bounty}}}} and {{XP|{{G|illusion fixed bounty}}}}, regardless of their level:
* {{A|Phantom Lancer|Spirit Lance}}
* {{A|Phantom Lancer|Doppelganger}}
* {{A|Phantom Lancer|Juxtapose}} (created by Phantom Lancer and from his illusions)
* {{A|Dark Seer|Wall of Replica}}

===Copying Buffs and Debuffs===
Usually when an illusion is created, it usually does not copy the buffs and debuffs the original hero has.

There are some exceptions, however, Illusions copy the toggled {{Key special|onoff}} statuses of items and of some abilities. 

The following buffs are copied by illusions:

==Active Abilities==
Illusions may not use active abilities and items, but they might inherit ongoing abilities from the original hero if the ability was cast before creating the illusion. Only a few abilities have different effect when the cast is an illusion.

===Casting Fake Abilities===
Within a certain conditions, some abilities causes all illusions owned by the illusion creator within certain range from the target will also fake cast the ability, while the real hero casts the ability. 

This is mainly for camouflaging the real hero and their illusions. The illusions still cannot use any active abilities.

These illusions have the following behavior:
* The illusion play the whole cast animation and cast the fake ability at the same time the real ability is cast.
* When illusions currently are not having any order and are standing still, they all turn to face the target and cast the ability.
* When canceling the cast ({{Key press|S}}), the illusions still play the full cast animation, but do not release the fake ability.
* When illusions are moving or attacking, they continue to do so and do not turn to face the target. They still play the cast animation, overriding their move or attack animations.
* They play the whole cast animation and release their fake ability at the same time the real ability is released.
* These fake abilities do not interact with anything.

[[File:Boots of Travel Upgrade Town Portal Scroll abilityicon dota2 wikiasset.png|frame]]
{{Quotation|Dark Seer|Speed is the heart of battle.|sound=vo_dark_seer_dkseer move 10.mp3}}

&lt;dfn&gt;Movement Speed&lt;/dfn&gt; (sometimes abbreviated as Move Speed) is the speed or distance at which a unit can move over a second. 

The default movement speed limit is at {{G|movement speed min}} on the low end, and {{G|movement speed max}} on the high end, which can be bypassed by only a few abilities. Only units capable of moving can have a movement speed. This means granting a non-mobile unit movement speed from movement speed bonus sources do not allow them to move still.

A unit's movement speed can be increased by abilities, [[Movement speed#Items|items]] or {{Symbol|Talent}} [[Movement speed#Talent|talents]] granting either flat (e.g. {{I|Boots of Speed}}) or percentage-based values (e.g. {{I|Yasha}}).

===Total Movement Speed===
Calculating the total movement speed of a unit involves using a few values and a multiplier.

[[Movement Speed#Set Movement Speed|Set Movement Speed]] overrides the unit's original base movement speed, the value is still fully affected by flat and percentage-based movement speed changes within the movement speed limits. If the set value is [[Movement Speed#Absolute Movement Speed|absolute]], the absolute value is now the unit's Total Movement Speed.

Absolute Movement Speed can only be overridden by [[Movement Speed#Haste|Haste]] sources.

Flat movement speed bonuses from [[Movement speed#Stacking Restrictions|items]], abilities, and {{Symbol|Talent}} [[talent]]s stack independently of each other on the unit's base movement speed with restrictions, percentage-based bonuses and reductions are summed up, then applied to the unit's base movement speed as a multiplier.

All movement speed modifying sources may not exceed the minimum and maximum movement speed limits, unless either the limits are modified by [[Movement speed#Minimum Movement Speed|min movement speed]] sources or max movement speed unlocking sources. For example, in cases where the minimum movement speed is higher than the absolute movement speed value, the absolute value can only set the movement speed to the new minimum movement speed value of the unit.

The total movement speed displayed on the [[HUD]] is calculated using a few variables and multipliers and can be defined as:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{Treelist}}
* {{Symbol|Movement Speed}} Total Movement Speed
** = Set Move Speed Value
*** = Absolute Move Speed Value
*** = Haste Value, when Haste &gt; Min Move Speed; else Min Move Speed Value = Base Move Speed Value
** = Base Move Speed Value
** ± Flat Bonuses/Reductions (with [[Movement Speed#Stacking|Stacking Restrictions]])
** × Move Speed Multiplier
{{Treelist/end}}

===Equations===
{{Symbol|Movement Speed|size=20px}} &lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Move Speed = (Base + MAX({{I|Boots of Speed|size=20px}}-based) + Flat Changes) × Move Speed Multiplier&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Move Speed Multipler = 1 + [[Movement Speed#Percentage_Movement_Speed_Changes|Percentage-Based Changes]] &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + MAX({{I|Yasha|size=20px}}-%based)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Move Speed Range ⇒  &amp;#123; {{G|movement speed min}} ≤ x ≤ {{G|movement speed max}} &amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;

===Stacking===
Both flat and percentage-based movement speed bonuses, except percentage-based from abilities, have stacking restrictions and are separated into 4 groups. The flat movement speed bonuses from the same group do not stack with each other, with the one with a higher value taking priority. However, flat movement speed bonus sources from different groups stack independently of each other.

* '''Group 1:''' {{I|Boots of Speed}}-based items.
* '''Group 2:''' {{I|Yasha}}-based items.
* '''Group 3:''' {{I|Wind Lace}} itself.
* '''Group 4:''' Miscellaneous — Sources that do not belong to any of the first 3 groups fully stack with each other, with multiple of themselves, and with other item bonuses, including {{I|Wind Lace}}.

;Example 1a
: '''Within the Movement Speed Limits'''
: While with level 4 {{A|Windranger|Windrun}} active and affected by a level 4 {{A|Io|Tether}}, {{H|Windranger}} has {{I|Boots of Travel 2}}, a {{I|Wind Waker}} and {{I|Manta Style}}. What is her current movement speed?

: Flat Movement Speed Values
:: {{Hero icon|Windranger|20px}} Base Move Speed: {{Show|H|Windranger|movement speed}}
:: {{I|Boots of Travel 2}}: {{#vardefineecho:bots2 ms|{{#explode:{{Show|I|Boots of Travel|bonus movement speed flat}}|/|1}}}}
:: {{I|Wind Waker}}: {{#vardefineecho:waker ms|{{Show|I|Wind Waker|bonus movement speed flat}}}}

: Movement Speed Modifiers
:: {{A|Windranger|Windrun}}: {{#vardefineecho:run ms|{{#expr:({{#explode:{{Show|A|Windranger|Windrun|value2}}|%}}/100)}}}}
:: {{I|Manta Style}}: {{#vardefineecho:manta ms|{{#expr:({{Show|I|Manta Style|bonus movement speed percent}}/100)}}}}
:: {{A|Io|Tether}}: {{#vardefineecho:tether ms|{{#expr:({{#explode:{{#explode:{{Show|A|Io|Tether|value6}}|/|3}}|%}}/100)}}}}

: Total Movement Speed
: = {{#vardefineecho:ex1 ms|({{Show|H|Windranger|movement speed}} + {{#var:bots2 ms}} + {{#var:waker ms}}) * (1 + {{#var:run ms}} + {{#var:manta ms}} + {{#var:tether ms}})}}
: = {{#expr:{{#var:ex1 ms}}}}

{{H|Windranger}} has {{Symbol|Movement Speed}} {{#expr:{{#var:ex1 ms}}}} movement speed from abilities and items in this example, but it gets capped at {{G|movement speed max}}, so long she is not affected by anything that [[Movement Speed#Maximum Movement Speed|unlocks maximum movement speed]].

;Example 1b
: '''Movement Speed Limits is Applied After All Calculations'''
: {{H|Brewmaster}} initiates and casts a level 3 {{A|Brewmaster|Thunder Clap}}, and the same {{H|Windranger}} from the previous example is affected. What is her current movement speed?

: Movement Speed Modifiers
:: {{A|Windranger|Windrun}}: {{#var:run ms}}
:: {{I|Manta Style}}: {{#var:manta ms}}
:: {{A|Io|Tether}}: {{#var:tether ms}}
:: {{A|Brewmaster|Thunder Clap}}: &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;-{{#vardefineecho:tclap ms|{{#expr:({{#explode:{{Show|A|Brewmaster|Thunder Clap|value3}}|%/|2}}/100)}}}}&lt;/span&gt;

: Total Movement Speed
: = ({{Show|H|Windranger|movement speed}} + {{#var:bots2 ms}} + {{#var:waker ms}}) * (1 + {{#var:run ms}} + {{#var:manta ms}} + {{#var:tether ms}} &lt;span style="font-weight:bold; color:crimson;"&gt;- {{#var:tclap ms}}&lt;/span&gt;)
: = {{#vardefineecho:ex2 ms|{{#expr:({{Show|H|Windranger|movement speed}} + {{#var:bots2 ms}} + {{#var:waker ms}}) * (1 + {{#var:run ms}} + {{#var:manta ms}} + {{#var:tether ms}} - {{#var:tclap ms}})}}}}

{{H|Windranger}} now has a movement speed of {{Symbol|Movement Speed}} {{#var:ex2 ms}} in this example, which again gets capped at {{G|movement speed max}}. Therefore, the movement speed limits are only applied after the total movement speed calculations.

==Set Movement Speed==
'''Set Movement Speed''' sets a unit's total movement speed to a fixed value for the duration. The units are still fully affected by flat and percentage-based movement speed changes. The movement speed is still bound to the minimum and maximum movement speed limits. If a unit is affected by multiple abilities in this list, the lowest value takes priority.

The following abilities are able to override a unit's base movement speed, setting it at a certain value.

===Heroes===
The following list shows the base movement speed of all heroes, and their movement speeds with any {{I|Boots of Speed}}-based items. Does not include the innate {{Symbol|Nighttime}} nighttime movement speed bonus.

===Summons===
{{Grouped attribute table|unit|movement_speed|value heading=Movement Speed|extraConditions=[[extradata_type::Creep-Hero]]|unit heading=Summons}}

==Movement Speed Limits==
By default, the lower limit for movement speed is at {{G|movement speed min}}, while the upper limit lies at {{G|movement speed max}}. These values are the same for all units and cannot be exceeded by flat or percentage movement speed bonuses or reductions. Base movement speed changes cannot exceed these either.

===Minimum Movement Speed===
The following abilities are able to change a unit's minimum movement speed, preventing it from ever being lower than the set value. If a unit is affected by multiple abilities that change the minimum value, the higher value takes priority.
{{SkillListHead|collapse=no|title=Minimum Move Speed Changing Abilities}}

| notes shard = Requires {{I|Aghanim's Shard}}, otherwise it [[Movement Speed#Set Movement Speed|sets the caster's movement speed]] instead.
}}
{{SkillListTail}}

===Maximum Movement Speed===
The following abilities are able to change a unit's maximum movement speed (of {{G|movement speed max}}), allowing it to reach even higher values. If a unit is affected by multiple abilities that change the maximum value, the higher value takes priority.

{{SkillListTail}}

==Move Commands==
There are several different orders which make the unit move.

The default move command is bound to {{Key press|mouseright}} or {{Key press|M}}, it can also be bound to a {{Key press|hotkey}}. Targeting the ground with this command makes the unit move to that point, or until unable to get closer to the point (i.e. the target is out of reach). During a move command, the unit does not automatically attack enemies on the way.

The follow command is merged in with the default {{Key press|M}} move command and is executed with the same keys. To follow a unit, the move command has to be targeted at the desired unit to follow. Targeting an allied unit with the move command makes the unit follow the allied unit, until a new order is given or until the targeted unit dies. 

The follow range for most units is 100, meaning a unit ordered to follow another unit attempts to stay within the 100 range of the targeted unit. 

{{SkillListHead|title=Units with Different Follow Range}}
{{SkillListRich
| source = Juggernaut
| name = Healing Ward
| trait1 = Follow Range
| value1 = {{Show|U|Healing Ward|follow range}}
| notes =  In order to follow enemy units, the follow {{Key press|Hotkey}} must be used, since {{Key press|mouseright}} on an enemy automatically orders an attack on it.
}}
{{SkillListTail}}

===Patrol===
The patrol command makes the unit move back and forth between its starting location and the targeted point until it is given another order. A unit can be given multiple points to patrol. When doing so, the unit moves to the targeted points in the same order in which they were given. Upon reaching the last point, it moves back in reversed order. Just like the move command, the unit will automatically attack enemies it crosses while patrolling.

The default hotkey for the Patrol Command is {{Key press|blank}}.

===Attack-Move Command===
[[File:chasedpsthreshold.png|200px|thumb|Movement speed advantage required for a given attack efficiency when chasing]]
The default Attack-Move command is bound to {{Key press|A}}, it can also be bound to a {{Key press|hotkey}}. 

Identical to the move command, with the difference being the ordered unit attacking any enemy they cross while moving. This order can be given by giving an attack order on the ground. To do this, the attack {{Key press|hotkey}} must be used. If the unit crosses no enemies during an attack move order, it essentially acts as a move order. When an enemy gets within the unit's [[Attack range#Acquisition Range|acquisition range]], it goes towards that enemy and attacks it. If the target can no longer be attacked for any reason (upon [[death]], becomes [[ethereal]] or [[invulnerable]], turns [[invisible]] or [[Vision|loss of sight]] over target), the unit resumes moving towards the targeted point, continuing from its current location. It does not trace its way back to where it left the path to attack an enemy.

[[File:Counter Helix icon.png|frame]]
{{Quotation|Gyrocopter|Let's go for a spin!|sound=vo_gyrocopter_gyro_spawn_02.mp3}}
&lt;dfn&gt;Turn rate&lt;/dfn&gt; is the speed at which a unit can turn. When moving to a location, a unit first turns to face that location, then begins walking. Similarly, when targeting another unit with an attack or spell, a unit first turns until it is facing the target, and then continues with the action. A unit only starts moving, or only starts casting a spell on a targeted area or point when the target is within 11.5°&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.dota2.com/2015/03/various-pathfinding-fixes/ Confirmation of required facing angle being 11.5° (2nd paragraph)]&lt;/ref&gt; angle in front of the ordered unit. This can make [[Glossary#K - O|kiting]] more difficult, as the hero has to spend time turning towards and away from the target with each attack.

Every unit has a base turn rate, which can be lowered by some abilities. The vast majority of heroes have a turn rate between 0.6 and 0.5, meaning it takes between 0.15 and 0.19 seconds for the hero to make a 180° turn.

There are currently no {{Symbol|Talent}} [[talents]] that improve turn rate.

==Mechanics==
&lt;pre&gt;Turn rate speed was improved by 20% in [[7.29]]&lt;/pre&gt;
Turn rate is expressed in radians per 0.03 seconds. A 180° turn is the same as &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; (3.1416) radians, therefore 0.03&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; divided by the turn rate of the unit equals the time it takes to turn 180°. 

Turn rate is defined as 

: {{#tag:math|
t = \frac{0.03\pi}{T}
}}

With &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; being the time it takes to turn around and &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; the turn rate sources.

Turn rate slow directly affects the base turn rate, and all sources of turn rate slow stack multiplicatively. 

: &lt;math&gt;\sum T = 
 \begin{cases}
 T_{Set} &amp; \text{if} \;\; T_{Set} = \top \\
 T_{b} \times \displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^n (1-r_i)(1+a_i) &amp; \text{otherwise} 
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;code&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;Set&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; being the [[Turn rate#Turn Rate Setting Abilities|Set Turn Rate Value]], &lt;code&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; the Base Turn Rate, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; the Turn Rate Slow Value and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; the Turn Rate Improve Value.

A unit does not immediately start turning at the highest rate it can turn. The turn rate ramps as the unit starts turning, reaching the unit's max turn rate after a certain amount of time. The rate at which the turn rate ramps up is unknown.

If a unit starts turning due to an ability or item cast order (by targeting a point, area or unit which is not within the required 11.5° facing angle), the turning cannot be canceled by a move, attack or a new spell cast order. Because the 11.5° angle can be in either direction, this creates a 23° angle directly in front of the hero allowing instant actions on any target within 23°. For any target beyond this angle, the hero must wait until they turn before the action occurs. The above formula is used to find the maximum time, so the time until the action takes place is actually ≤ 168.5°. 

Any command ordered while turning due to a spell cast order gets queued up and executed once the spell is cast. In order to cancel the spell or ability cast, the player must issue a stop or halt command, in the same way how to cancel spell during its cast animation. This is to prevent accidental canceling of casts due to fast clicking. Issuing a stop or halt command (with {{Key press|S}}) does not stop the unit from turning if it has already started to turn, but stops the order which initiated the turning. For example, this allows {{H|Templar Assassin}} to turn during {{A|Templar Assassin|Meld}} without canceling the ability, as long as the move command is stopped before the targeted point is within the required angle.

===Stacking===
;Example 1&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:70p slow|0.3}}&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:50p slow|0.5}}&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:pi|3.1416}}&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:earthshaker tr|{{Show|H|Earthshaker|turn rate}}}}&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:earthshaker atr|{{#expr:{{#var:earthshaker tr}} * {{#var:70p slow}}}}}}&lt;!--

--&gt;{{#vardefine:earthshaker t|{{#expr:(0.03 * 3.1416) / ({{#var:earthshaker atr}}) round 3}}}}&lt;!--
--&gt;{{#vardefine:earthshaker t2|{{#expr:(0.03 * 3.1416) / ({{#var:earthshaker atr2}}) round 3}}}}

: {{H|Earthshaker}} is affected by a turn rate slow of 70%. What is his current actual turn rate? How long would it take for him to turn  180°?

: {{#tag:math|
T = {{#var:earthshaker tr}} \times (1 - 0.7) = {{#var:earthshaker atr}}
}}

: {{#tag:math|
t = \frac{ 0.03\pi }{ {{#var:earthshaker atr}} } = {{#var:earthshaker t}}
}}

: {{H|Earthshaker}} affected by a turn rate slow of 70% has a lowered turn rate of {{#var:earthshaker atr}} and it takes him roughly {{#var:earthshaker t}}s to turn 180° in this example.

;Example 2

: {{H|Earthshaker}} is affected by two turn rate slows of 70% and 50%. What is his current actual turn rate? How long would it take for him to turn 180°?

: {{#tag:math|
T = {{#var:earthshaker tr}} \times (1 - 0.7) \times (1 - 0.5) = {{#var:earthshaker atr2}}
}}

: {{#tag:math|
t = \frac{ 0.03\pi }{ {{#var:earthshaker atr2}} } = {{#var:earthshaker t2}}
}}

: {{H|Earthshaker}} affected by two turn rate slow of 70% and 50% has a lowered turn rate of {{#var:earthshaker atr2}} and it takes him roughly {{#var:earthshaker t2}}s to turn 180° in this example.

==Modifying Turn Rate==
Several abilities and items have abilities that slows or improve turn rate. For better readability, some of the turn rates in Hero pages are given as degrees per second, instead of radians per 0.03 seconds. 

===Turn Rate Slowing Abilities===
The following abilities slows turn rate:

Highest value takes precedence.

[[File:Sniper Take Aim abilityicon dota2 gameasset.png|frame]]
{{Quotation|Sniper|On target!|sound=vo_sniper_helmet_snip_lasthit_04.mp3}}
The attack range is the maximum distance of how far a normal attack would hit between the attacker and the unit being attacked. The attack range itself is not what decides if a unit is classified as {{Symbol|Ranged}} Ranged or {{Symbol|Melee}} Melee. This characteristic is set for each unit individually, regardless of their actual attack range. This means that it is possible for a melee unit to have a higher attack range than a ranged unit.

==Definitions==
Some heroes have abilities that allow them to switch between {{Symbol|Melee}} melee and {{Symbol|Ranged}} ranged form, allowing them to benefit from both forms for a timed duration.

===Miss Chance===
{{Main|Evasion}}
For {{Symbol|Melee}} melee units, {{#lst:Evasion|Melee Attack Buffer}} &lt;section begin=Total Melee Attack Range /&gt;For most {{Symbol|Melee}} melee heroes, the attack buffer range is defined as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:110%; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Total Melee Buffer Range = Unit Total Attack Range + Attacker [[Unit Size#Bound Radius|Bound Radius]] + Target Bound Radius + {{G|melee miss range}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;section end=Total Melee Attack Range /&gt;

For {{Symbol|Ranged}} ranged units, they are affected by the [[Evasion#Uphill Miss Chance|uphill miss chance]]. {{#lst:Evasion|Uphill Miss Chance}}

===Motion Buffer===
{{See also|Cast Range#Unit Target|Unit Size#Bound Radius|l1=Cast Range|l2=Bound Radius}}
The default motion buffer range for attack range is {{G|attack range buffer}}, this range prevents attacks (and [[Cast range#Unit Target|unit-targeted]] abilities) from canceling when the target moves out of the attack range, or before reaching the attack point.

For all normal attacks, this can be defined as:&lt;br&gt;
{{#lst:Unit Size|Attack Range Calc}}

;Example 1
{{#lst:Unit Size|Attack Range Example}}

===Acquisition Range===
In order to prevent units from automatically attacking any visible enemy unit, they have a certain '''acquisition range'''. This range determines how close an enemy has to get in order for the unit to attack it automatically. Since this only goes for auto attacks, this range has no influence on units that have auto attack set to {{Key press|autoattack/never}} in the game options.

The default acquisition range is 600 for melee heroes, and 800 for ranged heroes. There are some exceptions to this mainly due to abilities.

==Base Attack Range==
'''Base Attack Range''' consists of one fixed value set for each unit individually. It can be further modified by attack range bonuses based on the unit's attack range type.

===Heroes===
Most {{Symbol|Melee}} [[melee]] heroes have an attack range of 150.

===Spell Steal===
{{Main|Rubick/Spell Steal Interactions|l1=Spell Steal Interactions}}
Most abilities acquired with {{A|Rubick|Spell Steal}} which modifies attack range also fully affect {{H|Rubick}}'s attack range for their duration when stolen and used, with the exception of {{A|Dragon Knight|Elder Dragon Form}} and {{A|Terrorblade|Metamorphosis}}. See [[Rubick/Spell Steal Interactions#Transformation Abilities|here]] for details.

===Active Attack Modifiers===
All [[active attack modifier]]-based abilities' cast range is based on the caster's attack range. The cast range can be further increased by other [[attack range]] bonuses of the caster's range type. For example, {{I|Dragon Lance}} for {{Symbol|Ranged}} ranged heroes and {{I|Penta-Edged Sword}} for {{Symbol|Melee}} melee heroes. These active attack modifiers are '''not''' affected by cast range bonuses.

Depending on the ability itself, certain abilities use the cast range when cast manually (or when using the designated {{Key press|Hotkey}}) and use the hero's attack range when set to {{Key special|Autocast}}. This information can be found in the abilities' respective notes.

:''For a full list of hero talents, see [[List of all talents|here]].''

The [[Talent Tree]] is a series of selectable talents a hero can choose. Talents offer a wide variety of options for heroes, from additional stats to abilities that are difficult or impossible to obtain otherwise, such as reducing respawn time or increasing passive gold gain. 

==Details==
*Talents are unlocked at level 10/15/20/25.
*Leveling a talent costs a skill point, just like leveling other skills.
*Each level offers 2 unique options, and when a talent is chosen its counterpart on the other branch gets locked out until its unlocked again at level 27/28/29/30.
*Selecting a talent does not affect further talent.
**E.g., picking the left branch at level 10 does not force you to pick the left branch for the rest of the levels.
**Some talents grant a new ability themselves.
*Talent trees and the talents chosen are visible to both allies and enemies.
*Illusions will show the talent tree and the choices made by the hero at the point which the Illusion was created, and will not update if the hero makes further choices.

==Stats==
The following list describes how talent stats affect the user:
*[[Attributes]] granted by a talent are added as bonus attributes, not base attributes.
*[[Damage]] granted by a talent, unless stated otherwise, is added as [[bonus damage]], not base damage.
*[[Armor]] granted by a talent is added as bonus armor, not base armor.
*[[Mana Regen]] granted by a talent is added as bonus regen, not base regen.
*[[Magic Resistance]] granted by a talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources.
*[[Evasion]] granted by a talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources.
*[[Attack Range]] granted by a talent stacks additively with other sources.
*[[Spell Lifesteal]] granted by a talent stacks additively with other sources.

&lt;dfn&gt;Projectile Speed&lt;/dfn&gt; is the speed at which a unit's attack projectile travels. A projectile speed of 900 means the projectile travels 900 units per second. The base projectile speed is 900.

&lt;!--===Spell Reflection===
{{Main|Spell Reflection}}
The reflected abilities are akin to the reflecting hero casting the abilities back to the enemies, with an {{Symbol|Instant Cast}} [[instant cast]] time and without getting interrupted. The scaling values of reflected abilities are based on the reflecting hero's stats, and not on the original caster's. Therefore, projectile-based abilities are usually reflected if the affected target has a projectile speed upon impact. Heroes that have a projectile speed of 0 do not [[Spell Reflection|reflect]] any abilities.

==Heroes==
Heroes have an average projectile speed of {{Average|projectile speed|hero}}.
